<h2>What Is the Hero Tournament of Power?</h2>

<p>Unlike regular events, the <strong>Hero Tournament of Power</strong> functions as a competitive progression race. Players are grouped based on their team level and in-game activity, ensuring a fair battleground where everyone faces opponents of similar strength. The main goal is to accumulate as many tournament points as possible by upgrading various hero attributes throughout the event’s duration.</p>

<p>Accessing the tournament is simple. Once the event begins, you’ll find its icon right on the main game screen. From there, you can dive into the competition, track your progress, and see how your efforts stack up against others in your group.</p>

<h2>How to Earn Tournament Points</h2>

<p>The backbone of this event is upgrading heroes. Every enhancement you make contributes to your tournament point total. Here’s a breakdown of which actions will earn you points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Increasing hero level</li>
  <li>Improving artifacts</li>
  <li>Enhancing Glyphs</li>
  <li>Upgrading Skins</li>
  <li>Advancing in the Gift of the Elements</li>
  <li>Hero evolution (star ranking)</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s important to note that only hero-related upgrades contribute to your score. Any investments in Titans or pets will not yield points in this specific tournament.</p>

<h3>Power Conversion to Points</h3>

<p>The conversion is simple: <strong>1 power = 1 tournament point</strong>. For example, if you upgrade a hero and their total power increases by 3,000, you’ll earn 3,000 points for that upgrade.</p>

<h3>Important Warning About Gift of the Elements</h3>

<p>If you reset the Gift of the Elements for any hero before or during the tournament, your hero’s power will temporarily drop. Re-investing those stats during the same tournament won't earn additional points if your Total Hero Power doesn’t surpass the highest value your account had previously reached. Therefore, avoid resetting the Gift of the Elements during this event if your goal is to maximize tournament points.</p>

<h2>Event Quests: Another Path to Victory</h2>

<p>Alongside the direct hero upgrades, you can also earn points and resources by completing event-specific quests. These are found in the <strong>Special Events</strong> tab or on the left-hand side of the tournament window under the <strong>Event</strong> section.</p>

<p>Quest chains include objectives like leveling up heroes, evolving them, upgrading skins, or enhancing artifacts. Completing these tasks not only contributes to your score but also grants you valuable resources such as gold, EXP potions, artifact fragments, and even Heroic Chests.</p>

<h2>Strategic Tips for Progress</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Prepare in advance:</strong> Stockpile resources like gold, EXP potions, and artifact components before the event begins.</li>
  <li><strong>Target your upgrades:</strong> Focus on heroes who yield the highest power return for the least resource cost. For example, enhancing a lower-rank hero’s artifacts can be more efficient than upgrading a maxed-out character’s Glyphs.</li>
  <li><strong>Daily consistency:</strong> Upgrade consistently across all five days. Don’t blow all your resources on day one; stage rewards reset daily and provide fresh opportunities to climb.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Understanding Tournament Grouping</h2>

<p>Your competition is not the entire server. Players are divided into groups based on their team level and general activity patterns. This makes the event fairer and ensures that players are matched with others at a comparable stage in progression.</p>

<p>Since groups are determined once the tournament begins, avoid changing your server during the event. If you do, all of your earned points will reset, and you’ll be placed in a new group, starting from scratch.</p>

<h2>Rewards Breakdown</h2>

<p>The tournament offers two types of rewards:</p>

<h3>1. Stage Rewards (Daily)</h3>

<p>Each day, you can claim stage rewards by reaching certain point milestones shown on the progress bar. This bar resets daily at <strong>2:00 AM UTC</strong>. If you forget to collect your rewards, they will be automatically sent to your in-game mailbox. However, be aware that these mail rewards expire in three days.</p>

<h3>2. Final Rewards (End of Event)</h3>

<p>When the tournament concludes, the top 10 players in each group will receive final rewards. These typically include Heroic Chest keys, Skin Stones, artifact resources, and other valuable upgrade materials. The higher your position on the leaderboard, the better your rewards.</p>

<p>To view the leaderboard, simply click the <strong>Leaderboard</strong> button on the event interface. This shows your current rank, competitors’ points, and the rewards for each position.</p>

<h3>Tiebreaker Rule</h3>

<p>If two or more players have the same number of points when the tournament ends, the player who reached the score earlier will rank higher. This rule incentivizes not only maximizing your point total but also doing it quickly.</p>

<h3>Final Reward Collection</h3>

<p>After the event ends, it may take a short time for results to be processed. Once the rankings are finalized, rewards will be available directly in the event window. As with stage rewards, if you don’t claim your prize, it will be sent to your mailbox and will expire in 3 days.</p>

<h2>Event Store: Offers and Bundles</h2>

<p>During the tournament, you’ll also have access to limited-time offers in the <strong>Offers</strong> section. These bundles often include energy, gold, Skin Stones, and artifact resources to help boost your progress. Some of these are available for emeralds, while others may require real-world purchases.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The <strong>Hero Tournament of Power</strong> is more than just a leaderboard eventit’s a strategic sprint that rewards smart planning, resource management, and consistent effort. By understanding how points are calculated and how to efficiently upgrade your heroes, you can climb the ranks and secure powerful rewards.</p>

<p>Prepare before the tournament starts, play daily, and avoid unnecessary resets to maximize your gains. Whether you aim to dominate the top 10 or simply earn valuable resources for future events, this tournament offers meaningful progression for every type of player.</p>

<p>And remember your upgrades today could make the difference in tomorrow’s battles. Good luck in the arena of growth, and may your heroes rise to power!</p>
