    Orion is one of the most enigmatic mages in Hero Wars: Dominion Era. No one knows his origin some say he's a destroyer, others a savior. In the current PvP meta, Orion becomes a deadly force when paired with Augustus, Nebula, and Dante. This guide covers his strengths, team synergies, and why he remains one of the top intelligence-based heroes in the game.

<section>
<h2>Who Is Orion?</h2>
<p>Orion is a powerful backline mage who relies on Intelligence and rapid energy regeneration. His mysterious origins and devastating AoE magic make him a top-tier pick for PvP battles. When supported correctly, he can wipe out entire enemy teams within seconds.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Class:</strong> Mage</li>
  <li><strong>Position:</strong> Back Line</li>
  <li><strong>Main Stat:</strong> Intelligence</li>
</ul>


  <p>
    Orion excels in PvP when paired with Augustus, who lowers enemies' Magic Defense through his Superconductivity skill. This synergy boosts Orion’s already impressive damage by enabling him to deal pure damage when the enemies’ defenses are bypassed. Nebula enhances Orion’s magic damage, while Dante provides dodge and debuffs the enemy team, creating an optimal environment for Orion to thrive.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Augustus Skill – Superconductivity:</strong> Augustus applies Superconductivity each time he deals damage, reducing the target’s Magic Defense for 6 seconds. This effect can stack multiple times and refreshes its duration with every new application. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This mechanic pairs exceptionally well with Orion, whose attacks deliver rapid bursts of high magic damage combined with significant magic penetration. Thanks to this synergy, Orion is able to consistently bypass weakened Magic Defense and convert his hits into devastating pure damage, making his area-of-effect skills even deadlier in battle.
  </p>
  <p>
    <p>Orion becomes even more valuable in team compositions thanks to his first artifact, which enhances the entire team's ability to ignore enemies' magic defenses making him a natural fit alongside other spellcasters like Celeste, Helios, or Faceless. When paired with Dorian, Orion becomes unstoppable thanks to the vampirism bonus and his rapid attack speed, allowing him to sustain himself while dealing constant damage.   </p>
    <p>
His ascension upgrade adds even more impact by allowing him to launch additional rockets at enemies under control effects like stun or slow. This creates excellent synergy with heroes like Polaris who can apply those effects consistently. Since Orion fights from the back line and unleashes powerful area attacks, he pairs well with Dorian’s healing aura and performs impressively in PvE content such as the Campaign, the Brog boss battle, and Asgard’s Osh encounter.
    </p>

  <h2>Skills Guide - Orion</h2>
<p>Understand how Orion’s magic skills work and which ones you should upgrade first to boost his power in Hero Wars: Dominion Era.</p>

<div class="emblem">
  <div class="emblem-title">
    <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/hero/orion/total-destruction.webp" alt="Total Destruction: Hero Wars Dominion Era" title="Total Destruction - Hero Wars Dominion Era" loading="lazy">
    <h3>Total Destruction</h3>
  </div>
     <p>Orion fires 6 magic missiles at the enemies with the most health. This is his main damage skill and hits multiple strong enemies at once.</p>
    <p><strong>Ascension skill:</strong> Tactical Destruction – When enemies are stunned or slowed, they get a mark. Orion then fires extra missiles at those marked enemies, causing even more damage.</p>
    <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> High – This skill does massive area damage and becomes even stronger with ascension, making it Orion’s most important ability to level up first.</p>

    <h3>Magnetic Field</h3>
  </div>
  <p>
    Orion causes a magical explosion on the enemy’s backline, damaging multiple enemies and slowing them for 4 seconds. This gives your team more control and makes it harder for the enemy to escape or fight back quickly.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> Low – This skill is great for controlling fast or dangerous backline enemies. Upgrading it improves the damage and usefulness, but it’s not as critical as Orion’s main attack.</p>

    <h3>Antimatter Blast</h3>
  </div>
  <p>Fires a magic missile at the closest enemy, stunning them for 4 seconds and dealing magic damage. The stun chance is lower against high-level enemies.</p>
    <p><strong>Ascension skill:</strong> Antimatter Chain – After hitting the first target, the missile bounces to 2 more enemies, damaging and stunning them for 1 second each.</p>
    <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> Medium – This skill provides crowd control and becomes more valuable with ascension, spreading damage and stuns to multiple enemies.</p>

    <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/hero/orion/full-charge.webp" alt="Full Charge: Hero Wars Dominion Era" title="Full Charge - Hero Wars Dominion Era" loading="lazy">
    <h3>Full Charge</h3>
  </div>
  <p>
    This is a passive skill that gives Orion extra energy every time he attacks. More energy means he can use his main skill, Total Destruction, much faster and more often during fights.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> Very High – This skill directly affects how quickly Orion can use his most powerful attack. The faster he gains energy, the more dangerous he becomes. Max this early for maximum impact.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Pros and Cons of Orion Skills</h2>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>High Magic Damage Output:</strong> Orion’s <em>Total Destruction</em> skill rapidly fires multiple magic missiles, making him one of the strongest damage dealers in the game.</li>
  <li><strong>Fast Energy Gain:</strong> His passive skill <em>Full Charge</em> allows Orion to activate his ultimate much more frequently than most heroes.</li>
  <li><strong>Area Control:</strong> <em>Magnetic Field</em> adds crowd control by slowing backline enemies, disrupting healers and damage dealers.</li>
  <li><strong>Synergy with Armor Penetration:</strong> Works exceptionally well with heroes or artifacts that reduce magic defense, such as Augustus, making his magic attacks even more lethal.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Low Survivability:</strong> Orion has weak defenses and can be quickly eliminated if not protected by tanks or support heroes.</li>
  <li><strong>Relies on Energy:</strong> Without constant energy generation (like through <em>Full Charge</em> or supports like Augustus or Nebula), his damage output drops significantly.</li>
  <li><strong>Limited Crowd Control:</strong> Aside from one single-target stun, he lacks consistent control abilities, making him vulnerable to enemy casters and crowd-control heroes.</li>
  <li><strong>Needs Good Positioning:</strong> If enemy teams target Orion early or bypass your tank line, he may not survive long enough to make an impact.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Best Patronage for Orion</h2>
<p>In the current meta, Orion benefits most from pets that enhance survivability and magic output. Khorus leads with top synergy in magic-based teams.</p>

<div class="hero-tierlist">
    <h3>1st Place: Khorus</h3>
    <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/pets/khorus/khorus.webp" 
        alt="Pet Khorus - Hero Wars Dominion Era." title="Pet Khorus - Hero Wars Dominion Era." loading="lazy">
</div>
<p><strong>Khorus</strong> is Orion’s best patron in top meta teams. His <em>Resilience Aura</em> converts part of Orion’s magic damage into a shield, offering strong protection against physical threats. The aura also benefits Augustus and a third magic-based healer like Aidan or <a href="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/characters/thea-en.html">Thea</a>, who stand in synergy. Khorus increases Orion’s durability while enabling the entire magic core to sustain longer fights with enhanced shields and magic attack buffs from Augustus.</p>

<div class="hero-tierlist">
    <h3>2nd Place: Merlin</h3>
    <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/pets/merlin/merlin.webp" 
        alt="Pet Merlin - Hero Wars Dominion Era." title="Pet Merlin - Hero Wars Dominion Era." loading="lazy">
</div>
<p><strong>Merlin</strong> enhances Orion’s raw damage potential. His <em>Tempus Magica</em> increases the speed of magic skills, enabling Orion to trigger <em>Total Destruction</em> more frequently. He’s ideal when Orion is used in faster, burst-damage compositions rather than long, shield-based fights.</p>

<div class="hero-tierlist">
    <h3>3rd Place: Axel</h3>
    <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/pets/axel/axel.webp" 
        alt="Pet Axel - Hero Wars Dominion Era." title="Pet Axel - Hero Wars Dominion Era." loading="lazy">
</div>
<p><strong>Axel</strong> is a strong defensive pick. He distributes incoming damage among allies and prevents Orion from being instantly killed. Use Axel when facing teams with high single-target burst (like Dante or Keira), especially if you lack another protector or healer.</p>

<div class="hero-tierlist">
    <h3>4th Place: Mara</h3>
    <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/pets/mara/mara.webp" 
        alt="Pet Mara - Hero Wars Dominion Era." title="Pet Mara - Hero Wars Dominion Era." loading="lazy">
</div>
<p><strong>Mara</strong> extends the duration of Orion’s stun from <em>Antimatter Blast</em>, but since it’s a single-target control effect and Orion is not a control-focused hero, Mara is better in control-heavy setups, not as a standalone support for Orion.</p>

<div class="hero-tierlist">
    <h3>5th Place: Biscuit</h3>
    <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/pets/biscuit/biscuit.webp" 
        alt="Pet Biscuit - Hero Wars Dominion Era." title="Pet Biscuit - Hero Wars Dominion Era." loading="lazy">
</div>
<p><strong>Biscuit</strong> reduces enemy healing, which is useful in niche situations. However, this pet does not directly support Orion’s offensive or defensive core mechanics. It’s more situational and should be used only when healing denial is a critical tactic against your opponent.</p>

</div>

<div class="emblem">
  <div class="emblem-title">
    <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/hero/orion/lunar-skin.webp" alt="Orion Hero Wars: Dominion Era" title="Orion - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" loading="lazy">
    <h3>Lunar Skin (Health +106,645)</h3>
  </div>
  <p>Grants Orion more survivability by boosting health, making him slightly more durable in prolonged fights.</p>

    <h3>Romantic Skin (Armor +10,650)</h3>
  </div>
  <p>Improves Orion’s resistance to physical attacks, making him less vulnerable to heroes like Dante or Keira.</p>
  <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> Low – Situationally useful in defense setups, but often unnecessary when paired with strong protectors like Augustus or Axel.</p>
</div>

<div class="emblem">
  <div class="emblem-title">
    <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/hero/orion/cybernetic-skin.webp" alt="Orion Hero Wars: Dominion Era" title="Orion - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" loading="lazy">
    <h3>Cybernetic Skin (Magic Defense +10,665)</h3>
  </div>
  <p>Increases Orion’s resistance to enemy mages, helping against burst magic damage from heroes like Lars or Iris.</p>
  <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> Very Low – Least impactful unless your enemies run heavy magic burst. Better value comes from offense-focused skins.</p>

<p>Discover the artifact evolution priority for Orion in Hero Wars: Dominion Era, focusing on which item upgrades benefit their combat skills the most.</p>

<div class="emblem">

    <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/artifacts/weapon-orion-dd-901-arsenal.webp" alt="Orion Hero Wars: Dominion Era" title="Orion - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" loading="lazy">
    <h3>1st - Weapon: DD-901 Arsenal</h3>
  </div>
  <p>This artifact grants massive magic penetration to the entire team when activated, allowing Orion and allied mages to bypass enemy magic defense and deal full damage with their abilities.</p>
  <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> High – Orion's primary strength lies in rapid-fire magic attacks that deal heavy area damage. Maximizing this weapon amplifies his burst potential and enables better team-wide damage in mage-centric squads.</p>
</div>

<div class="emblem">
  <div class="emblem-title">

    <h3>2nd - Book: Manuscript of the Void</h3>
  </div>
  <p>This book increases both magic penetration and magic attack, directly strengthening Orion's offensive abilities and spell effectiveness.</p>
  <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> Medium – It enhances Orion’s personal damage significantly, especially in long fights. However, it doesn't help the team like the weapon, making it a solid second priority.</p>
</div>

<div class="emblem">

  </div>
  <p>This ring increases intelligence, which indirectly enhances Orion's magic attack, magic defense, and a bit of physical attack.</p>

        <h3>1st - Magic Attack Glyph:</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Increases Orion’s magic damage output, directly enhancing all his skills for stronger offense.</p>
    <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> High – This glyph significantly boosts damage, making it one of the most crucial for Orion.</p>

        <h3>4th - Health Glyph:</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Increases Orion’s health pool, improving his survivability in longer fights.</p>
    <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> Medium – Helpful for durability but less impactful than offensive glyphs.</p>

        <h3>2nd - Magic Penetration Glyph:</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Allows Orion’s magic attacks to bypass enemy magic defense, greatly improving damage against tanky foes.</p>
    <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> Very High – Essential for maximizing damage against resistant enemies, making it a top priority.</p>

        <h3>5th - Magic Defense Glyph:</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Improves Orion’s resistance to magic damage from enemies.</p>
    <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> Very Low – Defensive but not critical, since Orion’s main strength is offense.</p>

  <h2>How to Counter Orion Hero Wars: Dominion Era</h2>
  <div class="hero-tierlist">
    <h3>Cornelius</h3>
    <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/hero/cornelius/cornelius.webp" 
    alt="Cornelius - Hero Wars Dominion Era." title="Cornelius - Hero Wars Dominion Era." loading="lazy">
  
    <p>Cornelius specifically targets heroes with high Intelligence using his <strong>Ruthless Wisdom</strong> skill. Since Orion relies on Intelligence to scale his magic damage, Cornelius can eliminate him early in the battle with a devastating magic attack that bypasses Orion’s speed advantage.</p>
</div>

<div class="hero-tierlist">
    <h3>Isaac</h3>
    <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/hero/isaac/isaac.webp" 
    alt="Isaac - Hero Wars Dominion Era." title="Isaac - Hero Wars Dominion Era." loading="lazy">
  
   <p><strong>Isaac MP-300 Capacitor</strong> converts incoming magic damage into Charge instead of allowing Isaac’s team to gain energy from it. When Orion unleashes his rapid magic attacks, this passive ability reduces his effectiveness by denying him and his allies bonus energy, while empowering Isaac’s own offense. Tes’Lin, Isaac’s companion, absorbs that magic and gains Charge at four times the rate Orion’s team would have received energy turning Orion’s strength into Isaac’s advantage.</p>

</div>

<div class="hero-tierlist">
    <h3>Lian</h3>
    <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/hero/lian/lian.webp" 
    alt="Lian - Hero Wars Dominion Era." title="Lian - Hero Wars Dominion Era." loading="lazy">
  
    <p>Lian’s charm abilities allow her to reflect Orion’s aggression back onto his own team. Her <strong>Charm</strong> skill activates when she’s attacked, which can frequently interrupt Orion due to his area attacks, disabling him before he unleashes his full combo.</p>
</div>

<div class="hero-tierlist">
    <h3>Rufus</h3>
    <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/hero/rufus/rufus.webp" 
    alt="Rufus - Hero Wars Dominion Era." title="Rufus - Hero Wars Dominion Era." loading="lazy">
  
    <p>Rufus is practically immune to Orion’s magic-based skillset. Thanks to his passive that nullifies magic damage and his <strong>resurrection</strong> ability, Rufus can survive Orion’s bursts effortlessly and keep protecting his team while Orion wastes his energy.</p>
</div>

<div class="hero-tierlist">
    <h3>Satori</h3>
    <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/hero/satori/satori.webp" 
    alt="Satori - Hero Wars Dominion Era." title="Satori - Hero Wars Dominion Era." loading="lazy">
  
    <p>Orion gains energy quickly from allies and skill usage, which directly feeds into Satori’s <strong>Fox Fire Marks</strong>. As Orion continues casting, Satori’s marks accumulate and trigger massive retaliatory damage, punishing Orion for his aggressive energy gain and making him an easy target.</p>
</div>

<div class="hero-tierlist">
    <h3>Ziri</h3>
    <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/hero/ziri/ziri.webp" 
    alt="Ziri - Hero Wars Dominion Era." title="Ziri - Hero Wars Dominion Era." loading="lazy">
  
    <p>Ziri uses her <strong>Fountain of Life</strong> to force Orion’s opening attack to target her. This taunt pulls Orion’s high-damage first skill away from the backline, reducing team-wide damage. With her durability and <strong>self-healing</strong>, Ziri can absorb Orion’s burst and protect squishier allies.</p>
