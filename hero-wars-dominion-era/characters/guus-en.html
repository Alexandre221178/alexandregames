  <h2>Who Is Guus?</h2>
  <p>Guus might look like just an old man with a goose, but in Dominion Era, he's a lifesaving strategist. His quirky skills are surprisingly powerful, blending healing, protection, and disruption all in one feathery package.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Class:</strong> Healer</li>
    <li><strong>Position:</strong> Middle Line</li>
    <li><strong>Main Stat:</strong> Strength</li>
  </ul>

  <p>When enemies strike hard, Guus answers with golden goose magic that shields your team from devastating blows. His healing scales well and keeps your frontline strong.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, his gray geese swarm enemies, breaking their rhythm and causing mayhem. He's not just a support he's a feathered force of control and survival.</p>

<h2>Guus Pros and Cons – Hero Wars: Web and Facebook</h2>

<h3>✅ Pros</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Powerful multi-source healing:</strong> Guus has four distinct healing abilities that keep allies alive through direct and over-time healing.</li>
  <li><strong>Scales with physical attack:</strong> His healing scales with physical attack and Strength, allowing synergy with common glyphs and artifacts.</li>
  <li><strong>Golden Feather mechanic:</strong> Grants allies a strong passive heal and a safety net against lethal damage.</li>
  <li><strong>Great synergy with tanks and brawlers:</strong> Works well in front-loaded teams that benefit from sustained healing.</li>
  <li><strong>Energy-efficient ultimate:</strong> If interrupted, Guus retains partial Energy, allowing faster reuse of his ultimate.</li>
  <li><strong>Strong with War Flag of Recovery:</strong> Healing can be amplified further with the right War Flag and patronage support.</li>
</ul>

<h3>❌ Cons</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Highly vulnerable to anti-healing:</strong> Easily countered by Celeste, especially during <em>March of the Geese</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Ultimate channel is interruptible:</strong> Guus cannot act during his ultimate and is vulnerable to control effects like charm or displacement.</li>
  <li><strong>No offensive utility:</strong> Very limited damage output – gray geese provide minimal pressure.</li>
  <li><strong>Dependent on positioning:</strong> The effectiveness of healing depends on where allies are during Golden Goose deployment.</li>
  <li><strong>Needs investment:</strong> Requires upgraded glyphs, Strength skin, and high artifact levels to be consistently effective.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guus Skills Upgrade Priority - Hero Wars: Dominion Era</h2>
<p>Understand which Guus skills to upgrade first for the best healing and support results in Hero Wars: Dominion Era.</p>

<div class="emblem">
    <div class="emblem-title">
        <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/hero/guus/march-of-the-geese.webp" alt="March of the Geese: Hero Wars Dominion Era" title="March of the Geese - Hero Wars Dominion Era" loading="lazy">
        <h3>March of the Geese</h3>
    </div>
    <p>This is Guus's ultimate skill. For 5 seconds, golden geese heal allies and gray geese damage enemies. The healing and damage happen every 0.5 seconds. However, Guus cannot attack or use other skills during this time. If interrupted, he keeps some Energy based on the time left.</p>
    <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> <span style="color: darkgreen;"><b>Very High</b></span> – This skill brings the biggest healing impact in large fights and synergizes with his other abilities. More power here increases both healing and damage output significantly.</p>

        <h3>Feathers of Gold</h3>
   </div>
    <p>This skill gives all allies a Golden Feather that heals them over 5 seconds. It also has a passive: while March of the Geese is active, any ally healed by golden geese receives this feather as well.</p>
    <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> <span style="color: #4CAF50;"><b>High</b></span> – The healing effect is moderate, but the passive synergy with the ultimate skill increases overall healing during fights. Better at keeping your whole team healthy over time.</p>

        <h3>Guardian Goose</h3>
    </div>
    <p>This ability works like a protective shield. If an ally with a Golden Feather is about to drop below 25% HP, this skill heals them before the hit lands, and gives bonus healing based on how long the feather had left. It triggers only once per feather.</p>
    <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> <span style="color: #fd9800;"><b>Medium-High</b></span> – It can save allies from fatal damage, but it only works in specific moments. Still, upgrading it boosts the life-saving potential when it does activate.</p>

        <h3>Lay on Feathers</h3>
   </div>
    <p>This is Guus's basic attack skill. Instead of damaging enemies, he heals nearby allies who don’t already have a feather. It’s constant healing with every attack, but only affects one target at a time.</p>
    <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> <span style="color: #FFC107;"><b>Medium</b></span> – It gives consistent healing, but compared to his other skills, the impact is lower. Still useful in long fights or when no skills are ready.</p>

  <h2>Best Patronage for Guus</h2>
<p>Choosing the right pet for Guus boosts his survivability and healing power, especially in extended battles.</p>

<h3>1st Place:</h3>  
<div class="img-150px">    
     <a href="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/pet/oliver-en.html">
    <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/pets/oliver/oliver.webp" 
           alt="Pet Oliver - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" 
           title="Pet Oliver - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" 
           loading="lazy" 
           width="155" 
           height="130">
	<h4>Oliver</h4>  
     </a>
</div>

<p>Oliver is the best pet for Guus. He boosts Guus's health and armor — essential stats for a frontline support who often receives splash damage. More importantly, Oliver’s patronage skill passively heals Guus whenever his health drops below 50%, which complements Guus’s role as a persistent healer that needs to stay alive to cast his powerful skills like <em>March of the Geese</em>. This greatly increases his sustain in long fights, especially against AoE-heavy teams.</p>

<h3>2nd Place:</h3>  
<div class="img-150px">    
     <a href="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/pet/axel-en.html">
    <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/pets/axel/axel.webp" 
           alt="Pet Axel - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" 
           title="Pet Axel - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" 
           loading="lazy" 
           width="155" 
           height="130">
	<h4>Axel</h4>  
     </a>
</div>

<p>Axel offers strong defensive support by reducing burst damage. His patronage ensures that Guus cannot take more than a certain percentage of his max health in one hit, which is excellent against enemies like Ju, Iris, or K’arkh. Axel is especially useful in PvP or boss fights with high spike damage. However, he doesn't provide any healing or offensive synergy, so he's slightly less optimal than Oliver for Guus's kit.</p>

<h3>3rd Place:</h3>  
<div class="img-150px">    
     <a href="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/pet/khorus-en.html">
    <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/pets/khorus/khorus.webp" 
           alt="Pet Khorus - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" 
           title="Pet Khorus - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" 
           loading="lazy" 
           width="155" 
           height="130">
	<h4>Khorus</h4>  
     </a>
</div>

<p>Khorus provides magic attack and armor stats, which only moderately help Guus, since he scales mainly with **physical attack**. His shield mechanic benefits magic-based allies more and is less reliable on Guus. While the Resilience Aura can help absorb some physical damage, it's conditional and less effective in comparison to Oliver or Axel in terms of survivability and direct synergy with Guus's abilities.</p>

<h3>4th Place:</h3>  
<div class="img-150px">    
     <a href="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/pet/fenris-en.html">
    <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/pets/fenris/fenris.webp" 
           alt="Pet Fenris - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" 
           title="Pet Fenris - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" 
           loading="lazy" 
           width="155" 
           height="130">
	<h4>Fenris</h4>  
     </a>
</div>

<p>Fenris increases physical attack and armor penetration — both are relevant for Guus’s healing since it's based on physical attack. However, his patronage skill adds a chance to blind enemies with basic attacks, which is much more useful for damage dealers, not supports. Guus’s basic attacks are aimed at allies for healing, so the blind effect won't activate. This makes Fenris the least suitable pet for Guus despite the stat boost.</p>

  <h2>Best Skin for Guus – Hero Wars: Dominion Era</h2>
<p>Discover which skins for Guus offer the best performance boost in battle by supporting his core role as a physical-based support and healer.</p>

<div class="emblem">
    <div class="emblem-title">
        <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/hero/guus/default-skin.webp" alt="Guus Default Skin - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" title="Guus Default Skin - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" loading="lazy">
        <h3>Default Skin (Strength +1,365)</h3>
    </div>
    <p>The Default Skin increases Guus’s Strength, which is his <strong>main stat</strong>. This directly improves his <strong>health</strong> and <strong>physical attack</strong>, which both scale his healing output. Every 1 Strength point gives Guus 40 health and 1 point of physical attack. This makes it the most impactful skin for enhancing both survivability and skill performance.</p>
    <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> <span style="color: darkgreen;"><b>Very High</b></span> – Essential for increasing healing through physical attack and boosting Guus's durability with extra health.</p>
</div>

<div class="emblem">
    <div class="emblem-title">
        <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/hero/guus/angelic-skin.webp" alt="Guus Angelic Skin - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" title="Guus Angelic Skin - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" loading="lazy">
        <h3>Angelic Skin (Magic Defense +10,650)</h3>
    </div>
    <p>The Angelic Skin boosts Magic Defense, helping Guus survive against magic-based damage dealers like Iris, Lars, or Orion. While this doesn’t increase healing or skill effects directly, it makes him harder to kill, allowing him to stay active longer and continue healing allies. It’s more situational, useful mainly in PvP or magic-heavy boss fights.</p>
    <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> <span style="color: #FFC107;"><b>Medium</b></span> – Helpful for survivability against magic damage, but doesn’t enhance healing power or skill effectiveness directly.</p>
</div>

  <h2>Guus Artifact Evolution Priority Hero Wars: Dominion Era</h2>

<p>Learn the best order to upgrade Guus’s artifacts to maximize his healing and survivability power in Hero Wars: Dominion Era!</p>

<div class="emblem">
  <div class="emblem-title">
    <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/artifacts/weapon-guus-archgoose-feather.webp" alt="Archgoose Feather Hero Wars: Dominion Era" title="Archgoose Feather - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" loading="lazy">
    <h3>Weapon: Archgoose Feather</h3>
  </div>
  <p>This artifact boosts Guus’s <b>Armor</b> and activates in battle with 100% chance. The high Armor bonus helps protect the entire team by increasing Guus’s survivability, which is crucial for a healer.</p>
  <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> <span style="color: #4CAF50;"><b>High</b></span> – It ensures Guus stays alive longer in battle, letting him keep healing. However, it doesn’t boost his healing output directly, so it’s not the very top priority.</p>
</div>

<div class="emblem">
  <div class="emblem-title">
    <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/artifacts/alchemists-folio.webp" alt="Alchemist's Folio Hero Wars: Dominion Era" title="Alchemist's Folio - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" loading="lazy">
    <h3>Book: Alchemist's Folio</h3>
  </div>
  <p>This artifact provides <b>Armor Penetration</b> and <b>Physical Attack</b>, but Guus is a healer whose skills do not rely on damage. These stats do not benefit his healing or survivability directly.</p>
  <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> <span style="color: #F44336;"><b>Low</b></span> – These stats are not very useful for Guus’s role. It can be upgraded last unless you want small extra damage from gray geese.</p>
</div>

<div class="emblem">
  <div class="emblem-title">
    <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/artifacts/ring-of-strength.webp" alt="Ring of Strength Hero Wars: Dominion Era" title="Ring of Strength - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" loading="lazy">
    <h3>Ring: Ring of Strength</h3>
  </div>
  <p>This artifact increases <b>Strength</b>, which is Guus’s main stat. More Strength means more health and physical attack, which indirectly boosts his healing via skills like “Lay on Feathers” and survivability.</p>
  <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> <span style="color: darkgreen;"><b>Very High</b></span> – Boosts both healing output and durability. This is the most important artifact to level up early for Guus’s performance as a healer.</p>

    <div class="emblem-title">
        <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/glyphs/physical-attack.webp" alt="Guus Physical Attack Glyph - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" title="Physical Attack - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" loading="lazy">
        <h3>1st Glyph – Physical Attack:</h3>
    </div>
    <p>This glyph directly increases Guus's healing power, as all of his healing skills scale with physical attack. It also boosts his gray goose damage from <em>March of the Geese</em>, making it his most impactful glyph in both support and damage.</p>
    <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> <span style="color: darkgreen;"><b>Very High</b></span> – Maximizes both healing and damage, essential for Guus’s core functionality.</p>
</div>

<div class="emblem">
    <div class="emblem-title">
        <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/glyphs/strength.webp" alt="Guus Strength Glyph - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" title="Strength - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" loading="lazy">
        <h3>2nd Glyph – Strength:</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Strength is Guus’s <strong>main stat</strong>, increasing both his health and physical attack. This indirectly boosts his healing and improves his survivability. It’s slightly less effective than direct physical attack, but still highly valuable.</p>
    <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> <span style="color: #4CAF50;"><b>High</b></span> – Strong all-around boost to Guus’s healing and durability.</p>
</div>

<div class="emblem">
    <div class="emblem-title">
        <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/glyphs/health.webp" alt="Guus Health Glyph - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" title="Health - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" loading="lazy">
        <h3>3rd Glyph – Health:</h3>
    </div>
    <p>This glyph gives Guus a large health boost, which helps him survive longer in drawn-out fights. It doesn’t enhance healing, but is crucial in battles where Guus is frequently targeted or faces AoE damage.</p>
    <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> <span style="color: #fd9800;"><b>Medium-High</b></span> – Increases Guus’s staying power, especially useful in PvP or versus AoE teams.</p>
</div>

<div class="emblem">
    <div class="emblem-title">
        <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/glyphs/armor.webp" alt="Guus Armor Glyph - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" title="Armor - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" loading="lazy">
        <h3>4th Glyph – Armor:</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Armor helps reduce incoming physical damage. While it's helpful, Guus already heals himself and allies frequently, so pure defensive stats like armor are less urgent than improving his healing throughput.</p>
    <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> <span style="color: #FFC107;"><b>Medium</b></span> – Helps with survivability but doesn't affect healing or damage output directly.</p>
</div>

<div class="emblem">
    <div class="emblem-title">
        <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/glyphs/armor-penetration.webp" alt="Guus Armor Penetration Glyph - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" title="Armor Penetration - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" loading="lazy">
        <h3>5th Glyph – Armor Penetration:</h3>
    </div>
    <p>While Guus does deal some physical damage (like gray geese), he’s not meant to be a damage dealer. This glyph has very little value for him compared to healing-focused stats.</p>
    <p><strong>Evolution Priority:</strong> <span style="color: #F44336;"><b>Low</b></span> – Minimal impact on Guus's primary role. Better reserved for heroes focused on dealing physical damage.</p>

  <h2>How to Counter Guus – Hero Wars: Dominion Era</h2>
<p>These heroes shut down Guus by blocking or disabling his healing abilities through anti-heal mechanics or powerful control effects.</p>

<div class="img-150px">    
 <!--<a href="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/characters/celeste-en.html">-->    
       <h3>Celeste</h3>  
      <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/hero/celeste/celeste.webp" 
           alt="Celeste - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" 
           title="Celeste - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" 
           loading="lazy" 
           width="155" 
           height="130">
     </a>
</div>
<p><strong>Celeste</strong> is the most effective anti-healer against Guus. Her <strong>Cursed Flame</strong> blocks healing in an area and inverts it when switched at the right time. This completely nullifies Guus's <em>March of the Geese</em> and <em>Lay on Feathers</em> effects, turning his powerful support role into a dead slot. Position her to cover key allies and deny his golden goose healing.</p>

<div class="img-150px">    
  <!--      <a href="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/characters/jorgen-en.html"> -->
       <h3>Jorgen</h3>  
      <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/hero/jorgen/jorgen.webp" 
           alt="Jorgen - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" 
           title="Jorgen - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" 
           loading="lazy" 
           width="155" 
           height="130">
     </a>
</div>
<p><strong>Jorgen</strong> doesn’t block healing directly, but he is effective at disrupting Guus’s rhythm. His <strong>Torment</strong> and <strong>Leper Curse</strong> delay Energy gain and redirect it, which slows down Guus’s access to his ultimate <strong>March of the Geese</strong>. This means fewer healing geese and feathers throughout the battle, buying time for your team to eliminate key enemies before Guus recovers. He’s especially strong when paired with other anti-heal or burst damage heroes.</p>


<div class="img-150px">    
 <!--    <a href="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/characters/lian-en.html"> -->
       <h3>Lian</h3>  
      <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/hero/lian/lian.webp" 
           alt="Lian - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" 
           title="Lian - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" 
           loading="lazy" 
           width="155" 
           height="130">
     </a>
</div>
<p><strong>Lian</strong> disables Guus through charm control. When enemies attack her or allies while her passive is active, she charms them — including Guus. This interrupts his <strong>March of the Geese</strong>, delays healing, and stops basic attacks that apply feathers. Lian doesn't block healing directly, but her control can render Guus inactive during critical moments, especially if his Energy is nearly full.</p>

  <h2>Guus Best War Flag – Hero Wars: Dominion Era</h2>
<p>Guus benefits most from flags that enhance healing or reduce enemy sustain, boosting his effectiveness as a physical-based support and healer.</p>

<div class="emblem">
    <div class="emblem-title">
        <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/war-flags/war-flag-of-recovery.webp" alt="War Flag of Recovery - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" title="War Flag of Recovery - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" loading="lazy">
        <h3>War Flag of Recovery:</h3>
    </div>
    <p>This is the top choice for Guus. It increases all healing by 10%, which directly buffs the output of <em>March of the Geese</em>, <em>Feathers of Gold</em>, <em>Lay on Feathers</em>, and <em>Guardian Goose</em>. Since Guus is one of the most healing-focused heroes in the game, this flag amplifies his primary role in any team.</p>
    <p><strong>Guus and Team Benefit:</strong> Greatly increases his overall healing efficiency, helping allies survive burst damage and sustain longer in drawn-out battles.</p>
</div>

<div class="emblem">
    <div class="emblem-title">
        <img src="../../hero-wars-dominion-era/images/war-flags/war-flag-of-decline.webp" alt="War Flag of Decline - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" title="War Flag of Decline - Hero Wars: Dominion Era" loading="lazy">
        <h3>War Flag of Decline:</h3>
    </div>
    <p>This is a great secondary choice when Guus is on a control or attrition-based team. Reducing the enemy team’s healing by 10% makes it harder for opposing supports to outheal Guus’s pressure, especially in mirror matchups or against heroes like Aidan, Thea, or Celeste.</p>
    <p><strong>Guus and Team Benefit:</strong> Weakens the enemy team’s sustain, giving Guus’s team a healing advantage over time.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
Guus is a charming yet powerful addition to your Hero Wars: Dominion Era roster. While he may look like a quirky old man with a flock of geese, his ability to sustain your team, prevent lethal damage, and disrupt enemies makes him a valuable support hero. If you're looking for a healer who brings more than just raw healing someone who can protect allies over time and break enemy rhythmthen Guus is the perfect fit. 
</p>
<p>
With the right skill and artifact investments, Guus becomes a resilient, feathered wall between your team and defeat. Don’t underestimate the power of the goose!
