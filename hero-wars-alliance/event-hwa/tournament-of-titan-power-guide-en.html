  <h2>Key Strategies for Winning the Tournament of Titan Power</h2>
  
  <h3>Timing Your Upgrades</h3>
  <p>
      Timing plays a pivotal role in this tournament. While it may be tempting to spend your resources on the first day to get a head start, this approach can backfire. 
      Instead, save your upgrades for the final hours of the event. Here’s why:
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Gauge the Competition:</strong> By observing your competitors' progress over the first two days, you can assess how many points you'll need to overtake them.</li>
      <li><strong>Catch Opponents Off Guard:</strong> Many players expend their resources early, leaving little room for significant point gains on the last day. By holding back, you can make a sudden surge and secure a higher rank.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      For optimal results, log in during the final minutes of the event to make your upgrades and maximize your score.
  </p>

  <h3>Efficient Resource Management</h3>
  <p>
      Success in the Tournament of Titan Power requires meticulous resource planning. Here’s how to prepare in advance:
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Stockpile Resources:</strong> Save Titan Potions, artifact components, Titan Skin Stones, and gold throughout the month leading up to the event.</li>
      <li><strong>Prioritize Resource Allocation:</strong> Focus on upgrades that offer the most points. For example:
          <ul>
              <li>Level up Titan artifacts and stars, as they provide substantial power increases.</li>
              <li>Avoid gold-intensive upgrades early unless you have a surplus of coins. Instead, prioritize Titan Potions and Artifacts Stars Level that don’t require gold.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Daily Point Goals:</strong> Aim to hit the 5,000 point daily threshold to unlock all stage rewards. These rewards often include summoning spheres, skin stones, and Titan Potions, which will further boost your progress.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Tips for Beginners</h3>
  <p>
      If you're a newer player, you have unique advantages that can help you succeed in this tournament. Here’s what you need to know:
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Leverage Growth Potential:</strong> At earlier stages of the game, upgrading your Titans yields larger point increases compared to advanced players who need significantly more resources for incremental gains.</li>
      <li><strong>Focus on Core Titans:</strong> Concentrate on upgrading your main Titan team rather than spreading resources across multiple Titans. This ensures that your investments yield maximum results.</li>
      <li><strong>Unlock Titans Quickly:</strong> Use summoning spheres and potions to unlock more Titans and strengthen your lineup.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Competing Against Advanced Players</h3>
  <p>
      Advanced players, often referred to as "whales," may have access to more resources but face diminishing returns due to their already-maxed teams. Here’s how to outsmart them:
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Maximize Point Efficiency:</strong> Since whales have fewer upgrades left to make, they earn fewer points per resource spent. Focus on upgrades that give you a higher power increase for every resource used.</li>
      <li><strong>Be Strategic with Timing:</strong> Even if advanced players have a resource advantage, your ability to time upgrades effectively can give you the upper hand in a tight competition.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Understanding Tournament Mechanics</h2>
  
  <h3>Enrollment and Grouping</h3>
  <p>
      Players are grouped based on their team level and recent activity. Once the tournament begins, the group is locked, and no new participants can join. 
      This ensures fair competition, as players face others of similar strength.
  </p>

  <h3>Point Calculation</h3>
  <p>
      Tournament points are awarded based on the power increase of your Titans. Here’s what contributes to your score:
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Leveling Up Titans:</strong> Each level increase provides a small power boost.</li>
      <li><strong>Artifact Upgrades:</strong> Enhancing Titan artifacts can lead to significant power gains.</li>
      <li><strong>Star Ranks and Skins:</strong> Upgrading star ranks and skins not only improves performance but also adds substantial points to your score.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      Every point of power equals one tournament point, so prioritize upgrades that provide the highest returns.
  </p>

  <h2>Reward System and How to Maximize It</h2>
  
  <h3>Daily Rewards</h3>
  <p>
      The event includes daily stage rewards, which reset at 5:00 AM in your game’s time zone. These rewards include summoning spheres, skin stones, and Titan Potions. To maximize your gains:
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>Ensure you claim all rewards before the daily reset.</li>
      <li>Focus on upgrades that help you hit the 5,000 point threshold each day.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Final Rewards</h3>
  <p>The first-place reward is highly coveted and includes:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Exclusive Avatar:</strong> A symbol of your victory.</li>
      <li><strong>50,000 Titans Potions:</strong> Choose upgrades that benefit your Titan team the most.</li>
      <li><strong>10,000 Fairy Dust:</strong> Essential for level up titans artifacts.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      Even if you don’t win, the progress you make during the tournament will significantly strengthen your Titans for future battles.
  </p>
