  <section>  
     
    <p>What makes the Way of Eternity event particularly exciting is its focus on the Eternity faction, a group of heroes known for their unique abilities and synergies. From powerful tanks like Corvus to versatile supports like Morrigan, the Eternity faction offers a wide range of heroes that can fit into various team compositions. During the event, players are encouraged to complete a series of quests that reward them with event coins, which can be used to purchase exclusive items in the event shop. </p>

    <p>
      These quests range from simple tasks like logging in daily to more challenging objectives such as spending energy or opening chests in the Outland. By strategically planning your actions and prioritizing the most rewarding quests, you can maximize your gains and make significant progress in strengthening your Eternity faction heroes.
    </p>

      
    
    <h2>Featured Eternity Heroes: Who’s Worth Investing In?</h2>
    <p>During the event, there is always a featured hero. Below is a list of Eternity heroes to help you decide whether to invest in the featured hero’s soul stones or other items in the event shop:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Keira:</strong> Keira is a strong marksman, but as new heroes have been added, she has fallen out of the meta. Today, she is an option to avoid.</li>
        <li><strong>Phobos:</strong> An excellent mage with high damage and control over enemies, Phobos is great for both attack and defense.</li>
        <li><strong>Faceless:</strong> With the ability to copy the ultimate skills of allies and enemies and deliver area stuns, Faceless is an excellent choice for various teams.</li>
        <li><strong>Dante:</strong> One of the best meta heroes today. If you can get Dante, invest immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>K'arkh:</strong> Despite being very strong, like Keira, K'arkh has become weaker and is now out of the meta.</li>
        <li><strong>Iris:</strong> With great synergy with Dante and Octavia, Iris has deadly damage that poses a threat to any enemy in defense. However, Iris is quickly eliminated by Octavia if the enemy knows what to do.</li>
        <li><strong>Octavia:</strong> The Queen of Mirrors has synergy with physical dodge and works well with Dante, the King of Dodge. In addition to her excellent support skills, she also gives allies the chance to dodge even magical damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Tempus:</strong> His power to speed up allies and slow down enemies makes him a powerful control support for any team.</li>
        <li><strong>Corvus:</strong> The Eternity tank has been strong since its release and remains one of the best tanks to invest in.</li>
        <li><strong>Morrigan:</strong> The Eternity healer who boosts allies' defenses and prevents enemies from using resurrection is a key piece for both Eternity allies and against resurrecting enemies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rarity of Eternity Faction Soul Stones</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rare Soul Stones:</strong> Rare Soul Stones are only available through events or soul stone chests. Examples: Octavia, Tempus.</li>
        <li><strong>Medium Difficulty Soul Stones:</strong> These are available in various in-game shops, Soul Stone Chests, and Events. Examples: Dante, Faceless, Corvus, Iris, K'arkh, Morrigan.</li>
        <li><strong>Easy Soul Stones:</strong> These can be obtained through the campaign and events. Examples: Keira, Phobos.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips and Strategies for Way of Eternity Event Quests</h2>
    <p>The Way of Eternity event features several quest chains that players can complete to earn Event Coins, Hero's Way Points, and other valuable rewards. These quests are designed to be completed over the three days of the event, and each has its own specific requirements.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Day After Day</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Log in to the game daily.</li>
                <li><strong>Rewards:</strong> Event Coins, Hero's Way Points.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Simply logging in every day during the event will grant you rewards. This quest is straightforward but essential for accumulating Event Coins.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Value Exchange</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Spend emeralds.</li>
                <li><strong>Rewards:</strong> Event Coins, Artifact Coins, Hero's Way Points.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Plan your spending wisely. If you’ve been saving emeralds, this is the perfect time to use them. Focus on spending them on necessary upgrades or energy refills that will further aid in completing other event quests.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Energy of Evolution</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Spend energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Rewards:</strong> Event Coins.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Use your energy to farm campaign missions that drop the soul stones of Eternity faction heroes. This will not only help you complete this quest but also gather resources to upgrade your heroes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Generous Soul</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Score VIP points.</li>
                <li><strong>Rewards:</strong> Event Coins.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> If you’re planning to make any purchases, do so during the event to maximize your VIP points and earn additional Event Coins.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Secrets of Outland</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Open chests in Outlands.</li>
                <li><strong>Rewards:</strong> Event Coins.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Save your Outland keys for this event. Opening chests in the Outland will not only help you complete this quest but also give you a chance to earn valuable items and hero skins.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Journey</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Begin Expeditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Rewards:</strong> Event Coins, Hero's Way Points.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Start expeditions as often as possible. Try to time your expeditions so that they finish during the event to collect the maximum number of Event Coins and Hero's Way Points.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>The Way Up</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Open chests in the Tower.</li>
                <li><strong>Rewards:</strong> Event Coins, Hero's Way Points.</li>
