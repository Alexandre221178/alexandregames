<h2>🔮 What is the Seer’s Game?</h2>
<p>The Seer’s Game is a time-limited event that becomes available once your team reaches level 15. It typically runs for <strong>3 days</strong> and appears on your main screen during that period. Once it's live, you’ll enter a mysterious card-drawing mini-game that feels like a mix of strategy and luck and with over 30 levels of escalating risk and reward, the excitement never stops!</p>

<h2>🎮 How the Mini-Game Works</h2>
<p>To enter a round of the Seer’s Game, you need to spend <strong>25 Seer's Orbs</strong>. There’s no limit to how many times you can play as long as you have Orbs to spend.</p>

<p>Each round presents you with up to four face-down cards. Most cards offer a reward, but one unlucky card could end your run immediately. It’s a classic gamble push forward for greater rewards, or retreat with what you’ve earned so far?</p>

<h3>🟢 Safe Rounds and Cursed Cards</h3>
<p>The first few rounds (typically rounds 1 to 4) are “safe rounds,” meaning none of the cards will end your game. After that, beginning from round 5, the cursed card is introduced, making each choice more suspenseful than the last.</p>

<p>If you draw the cursed card, the mini-game ends instantly and you lose all the rewards you’ve accumulated during that run. But there's a twist you can spend more Seer's Orbs to <strong>retry and continue from the same round</strong>.</p>

<h3>⚠️ Caution: Retry Costs</h3>
<p>The retry system is helpful, but it comes at an increasing cost. Each retry uses more Orbs than the previous one, and the retry price only resets once you start a new Seer’s Game attempt. If you run out of Orbs after drawing a cursed card, you’ll have no choice but to forfeit everything. So always manage your resources wisely!</p>

<h2>🎁 Seer’s Game Rewards</h2>
<p>Every time you select a lucky card and advance, you receive a random prize. As you progress through rounds, the rewards become increasingly valuable, and the <strong>card colors</strong> change to reflect their rarity green, blue, purple, orange, and eventually red.</p>

<p>Complete all 30 rounds, and you’ll walk away with a <strong>grand prize</strong>. The catch? You have to make it to the end without drawing the cursed card (or have enough Orbs to buy your way past it).</p>

<p>You can view potential rewards by clicking the “i” icon in the mini-game interface. As you collect rewards, they’re displayed at the bottom of the screen and added to your inventory only once the run ends either by reaching the final round or exiting voluntarily.</p>

<h3>💌 Bonus: Guild Milestone Rewards</h3>
<p>Teamwork pays off! When you reach specific rounds 8, 13, and 18 all your <strong>guildmates receive a bonus reward</strong> via in-game mail. So even if you’re the one playing, your entire guild celebrates your success. This feature encourages players to support each other and adds a sense of shared adventure to the event.</p>

<h2>🔧 How to Get Seer’s Orbs</h2>
<p>Seer's Orbs are the key to playing the event, and you can acquire them through several methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Event Quests</strong>: Complete daily and mission-based objectives to earn Orbs.</li>
  <li><strong>Purchasing Offers</strong>: Special bundles may be available in the in-game shop.</li>
  <li><strong>Mini-Game Rewards</strong>: Sometimes the lucky cards contain Orbs as a reward.</li>
</ul>

<h2>💡 Pro Tip: How to Avoid Losing Your Progress When You Hit a Bad Luck Card</h2>
<p>One of the most frustrating moments in the Seer’s Game is drawing the cursed card especially when you’re close to the final rounds and don’t have enough <strong>Seer’s Orbs</strong> left to continue. If you’re out of Orbs, you usually see two buttons: <strong>“Continue”</strong> (if you have Orbs) or <strong>“Leave”</strong>. Clicking “Leave” ends your run and erases all your gathered rewards even if you were just one round away from the grand prize skin!</p>

<p>But here’s a secret trick that experienced players are using to turn the odds in their favor. Instead of pressing “Leave,” you can <strong>safely exit the game without confirming your decision</strong> and return later. Here’s how:</p>

<figure class="img-review">

      <!-- Para telas grandes (PC-800x450px) de 50kb a 150kb -->
      <source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="../../hero-wars-alliance/images/events/seers-game/bad-luck-800px.webp">

  </picture>
  <figcaption>Bad Luck Seer's Game, Hero Wars Alliance.</figcaption>
</figure>


<h3>📱 Step-by-Step: Using the Game’s Home Button to Pause Bad Luck</h3>
<ol>
  <li>When the cursed card appears and you don’t have enough Orbs to continue, <strong>do not click “Leave.”</strong></li>
  <li>Instead, tap the <strong>“Home” icon in the top-right corner</strong> of the screen. This will exit you from the Seer’s Game back to the main menu.</li>
  <li>If you’re playing on mobile or using the web, you can also close the app or browser window entirely just make sure not to press “Leave.”</li>
  <li>When you log back into Hero Wars later, the game will take you to the start screen as usual.</li>
  <li>Now you’re free to <strong>complete more event quests</strong> and earn additional Seer’s Orbs.</li>
  <li>Once you have enough Orbs again, tap the Seer’s Game event and you’ll return exactly to the round where the cursed card appeared giving you a second chance!</li>
</ol>

<p>This trick works because the game only finalizes your rewards when you click "Leave." By exiting using the game’s interface or force-closing the app, your current game session is <strong>preserved in memory</strong>, allowing you to pick up right where you left off.</p>

<h3>🚫 What Happens If You Click “Leave”</h3>
<p>If you do click “Leave,” the game ends your current run, all your progress is lost, and you’ll have to start again from round 1. This not only costs you time and resources but might also make it <strong>impossible to reach the grand prize</strong> especially if the prize is a limited-edition skin.</p>

<h3>🎯 Why This Strategy Matters</h3>
<p>Using this method lets you pause your game and <strong>return later with enough Orbs</strong> to continue chasing that final reward. It’s especially useful during the last day of the event when you’re out of Orbs but still have quests left to complete.</p>

<p><strong>In short:</strong> Don’t panic when the cursed card shows up just pause, gather more resources, and come back stronger!</p>



<h2>🎯 Strategy Tips for Winning</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Know when to walk away</strong>: Don’t get greedy. If you’re deep in a run and feeling nervous, it might be smart to collect your rewards early instead of risking it all.</li>
  <li><strong>Save your Orbs</strong>: Hoard Seer’s Orbs ahead of the event or plan purchases wisely. Running out mid-run can be devastating if a cursed card appears.</li>
  <li><strong>Prioritize quests that give Orbs</strong>: Complete the daily login and early event quests as soon as possible to build a healthy stockpile of Seer’s Orbs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>✨ Why the Seer's Game is So Engaging</h2>
<p>There’s something magical about mixing strategy with a little bit of luck. Each card draw feels like a mini-heartbeat will you get that epic artifact chest, or will the cursed card send your dreams crashing? It’s this suspense that makes the event so addicting.</p>

<p>On top of that, the event feels rewarding even if you don’t reach the end. The quests, guild rewards, and mini-wins along the way make it enjoyable for players of all levels. Whether you're going for the grand prize or just trying your luck for fun, there’s always something to gain.</p>

<h2>🧠 Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The Seer’s Game isn’t just about chance it’s about managing risk, optimizing opportunities, and knowing when to push forward or walk away. Whether you aim to reach round 30 or play a few safe games for resources, the event provides a refreshing change of pace and a rush of excitement in Hero Wars Alliance.</p>

<p><strong>Have fun, trust your instincts, and may the lucky cards be ever in your favor!</strong></p>
