        <h2>Titan Power Event Introduction</h2>
  


    
        <p>The Titan Power Event in Hero Wars Alliance is an exciting opportunity for players to strengthen their Titan army and unlock rare rewards, including powerful Titan skins and other exclusive items. Alongside this, there’s also the Titan Power Tournament, where players compete for the highest ranks while completing missions that offer valuable resources. This guide will cover all the essential missions of the Titan Power Event, provide tips on how to prioritize tasks, and offer advice on what to purchase from the event shops. Let's dive into the event, and I’ll share my personal recommendations for both beginner and veteran players.</p>


<!-- adx-2 joinads with lazy -->

<!-- adx-2 joinads with lazy -->



    <h2>Overview of the Titan Power Event</h2>
    <p>The Titan Power event spans four days, giving players ample time to complete missions, earn rewards, and upgrade their Titans. One of the standout features of this event is the inclusion of Super Titan Solaris, a powerful Titan with immense potential. This is also the first time players can earn Titan skins for free through the event, making it a valuable opportunity for both collectors and competitive players alike.</p>
    <p>The event comprises several missions, each offering specific rewards like Champion’s Coins, which can be used in the event shop. This event is especially beneficial for those looking to improve their Titan team or for those who are new to the game. I'll break down each mission and offer tips on how to prioritize your efforts.</p>

    <h2>Day After Day – Logging In for Rewards</h2>
    <p>The Day After Day mission rewards players for logging into the game each day during the event. Over four days, you can earn Champion’s Coins, which can be used in the event shop. These coins are crucial for purchasing event-exclusive items, including Solaris’s Soul Stones and Titan skins.</p>

    <h2>Value Exchange – Spending Emeralds</h2>
    <p>In the Value Exchange mission, you earn rewards by spending Emeralds. The more Emeralds you spend, the more Champion’s Crates you can unlock. These crates contain various rewards, including Season Points, Titan Skins, and evolution resources. The crates can also reward Titan Skin Stones, making this mission a top priority if you're looking to upgrade your Titans.</p>

    <h2>Generous Soul – VIP Points</h2>
    <p>By earning VIP Points each day, you can unlock additional Champion’s Coins and Champion’s Crates. This mission can be completed every day, offering a steady stream of resources. If you have been purchasing VIP points or leveling up your VIP status, you’ll quickly complete this mission.</p>

    <h2>Energy of Evolution – Spend Energy</h2>
    <p>In the Energy of Evolution mission, you need to spend energy throughout the event. The more energy you spend (from 100 to 6000), the more Champion’s Coins you can earn. It’s a good idea to focus your energy on completing campaign missions or farming resources needed to upgrade your Titans. The rewards scale as you spend more energy, so this mission can net you a significant amount of Champion’s Coins.</p>

    <h2>Titanic Contribution – Completing Dungeon Levels</h2>
    <p>Titanic Contribution is all about completing levels in the Dungeon. If you’re not yet a veteran player and struggle with dungeon levels, don’t worry! There’s a helpful guide on the Alexandre Games site that provides strategies for completing the dungeon efficiently. For those who are struggling, you can also buy Titanite from the VIP shop for 300 Emeralds a day. Over the four days of the event, this adds up to 300 Titanite, making it easier to hit the targets needed for the event rewards.</p>

    <h2>Fury's Awakening – Enhancing Titan Skins</h2>
    <p>The Fury’s Awakening mission requires you to improve your Titan skins. You can earn Fairy Dust and Champion’s Coins for enhancing the skins of Titans like Nova, Vulcan, Silva, Mairi, Ignis, and Avalon. Although these Titans are not the strongest in the game, the rewards you receive are still valuable. Focus on Titans that are more integral to your strategy for better long-term benefits.</p>

    <h2>Power Unleashed – Opening Summoning Circles</h2>
    <p>This mission rewards players for opening Summoning Circles. The more circles you open, the more rewards you unlock, scaling up to 800 circles. These rewards include Champion’s Crates and Champion’s Coins. If you're part of a strong guild that completes Hydra missions every day, you’ll already have plenty of Titan Summoning Spheres to open, so stock up on them before the event starts.</p>

    <h2>Awakening – Opening Elemental Spheres</h2>
    <p>The final mission in the event is Awakening, where you open Elemental Spheres. The more spheres you open, the more Champion’s Coins you’ll earn. This mission is challenging because opening spheres can quickly drain your resources. However, if you’ve been saving up, now is the perfect time to open them to maximize your rewards. Opening up to 1500 spheres can net you a massive number of Champion’s Coins.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Beginners and Veterans</h2>
    <h3>For Beginners:</h3>
    <p>If you're new to Hero Wars Alliance, it’s best to prioritize purchasing Titan Potions from the event shop. Although Titan Skins are appealing, you won’t have enough Gold to level them up yet. Instead, focus on raising the star level of your Titan Artifacts by purchasing Titan Artifact Seals. These seals provide bonuses like extra health and physical attack, which are critical for your Titans’ performance in the Dungeon.</p>
    <p>Avoid spending your resources on Fairy Dust early in the game, as it’s costly and you won’t have suficiente Gold para fazer upgrades completos. É melhor economizar seu Gold para melhorias mais importantes.</p>




    <h3>For Veterans:</h3>
    <p>As a veteran player, your focus should be on Super Titan Solaris and the event shop’s Titan Skins. Solaris is an excellent addition to any Titan team, and now’s your chance to unlock her for free. Make sure to spend your resources wisely in the event shop. You’ll want to pick up the Primordial Skin for Titans like Hyperion, Araj, and Eden, as these skins provide massive boosts to their physical attack, making them more potent in both Dungeon and Guild Wars.</p>
    <p>Hyperion’s Primordial Skin, for example, boosts his physical attack, enhancing both his healing and damage capabilities. For Araj, his Primordial Skin also improves his attack, making him a powerful choice for your attack lineups in Guild Wars. Finally, Eden is a defensive powerhouse, and his skin helps him deal even more damage while protecting your team with his ability to trap enemies underground.</p>

    <h2>Event Shop Recommendations</h2>
    <p>The event shop is filled with exciting items, but not all of them are worth your investment. Here’s what to focus on based on your experience level:</p>

    <h3>For beginners:</h3>
    <p>Prioritize Titan Potions and Artifact Seals. These will help you progress in the Dungeon and improve your Titan’s star level, which directly impacts their health and attack power.</p>
    <h3>For veterans:</h3>
    <p>Focus on Super Titan Solaris Soul Stones, Titan Skins, and Artifact Weapon Parts. These will help maximize your team’s potential in high-level content.</p>
