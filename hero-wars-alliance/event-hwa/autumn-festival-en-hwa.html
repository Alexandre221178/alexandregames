    <h2>Event Overview</h2>
    <p>This special Autumn Festival event is featured in the <strong>Special Events</strong> tab within the game. You can find it listed separately under a unique tab, allowing easy access to the event quests and rewards. During the event, you will embark on a series of quest chains, each offering a chance to earn <strong>Harunian Brew</strong>. The event is designed to cater to a wide variety of play styles and game focuses, ensuring that all players have the opportunity to participate.</p>

    <p>The event's structure revolves around completing specific tasks, such as logging into the game, spending resources like emeralds, gathering titanite, and obtaining soul stones for heroes. These activities, which are part of the game's daily progression, now offer the additional benefit of contributing to your event rewards.</p>

    <h2>The Importance of Harunian Brew</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Harunian Brew</strong> is the central reward currency for the Autumn Festival. Each bottle of Harunian Brew can be exchanged for various in-game items, which can range from rare equipment fragments to precious resources like <strong>Artifact Coins</strong>, <strong>Titan Potions</strong>, and even <strong>Gold</strong>. What makes the Harunian Brew especially valuable is its ability to offer rewards that may otherwise take a longer time to collect during standard gameplay. For players looking to optimize their heroes and overall account power, this event provides an efficient boost to progress.</p>

    <p>Because the event is limited to just three days, it’s crucial to focus on completing as many quests as possible. The short duration creates a sense of urgency but also ensures that those who are active during the event can make significant progress in a short amount of time.</p>

    <h2>Event Quest Chains</h2>
    <p>The Autumn Festival offers several quest chains designed to target different aspects of gameplay. Here’s an in-depth look at each of the quest chains, including tips and strategies for completing them efficiently:</p>

    <h3>1. Welcome Guest</h3>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Log in to the game daily.</p>
    <p>This is the simplest quest chain available and rewards players simply for being consistent in logging into the game. Each day that you log in during the event, you’ll receive a small amount of <strong>Harunian Brew</strong>. While this chain doesn’t require any special effort, missing a day could result in a loss of rewards, so it’s essential to make logging in part of your daily routine.</p>

    <h3>2. Special Invitation</h3>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Reach specific VIP levels.</p>
    <p>This quest chain rewards players based on their VIP level within the game. <strong>Hero Wars Alliance</strong> utilizes a VIP system, which provides various benefits based on how much players have spent on in-game purchases. Each VIP level offers certain advantages, such as increased rewards or additional gameplay features.</p>

    <h3>3. Business Mindset</h3>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Spend emeralds to earn Harunian Brew.</p>
    <p>Emeralds are one of the most important premium currencies in Hero Wars Alliance, used for a wide variety of in-game purchases. The <strong>Business Mindset</strong> quest chain rewards players for spending emeralds during the event. If you’ve been saving emeralds, this is the perfect time to spend them for extra rewards.</p>

    <h3>4. Crystal Depths</h3>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Obtain titanite to receive Harunian Brew.</p>
    <p>Titanite is a resource that players collect in the dungeon by completing battles with their Titans. The <strong>Crystal Depths</strong> quest chain is ideal for players who are focusing on their Titan teams and dungeon progression. Completing dungeon levels efficiently will maximize your rewards.</p>

    <h3>5. Onwards and Upwards!</h3>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Open chests in the Tower to collect Harunian Brew.</p>
    <p>The Tower is a core gameplay mechanic in <strong>Hero Wars Alliance</strong>. The <strong>Onwards and Upwards!</strong> quest chain incentivizes players to open these chests, which contain valuable rewards. Aim to open as many chests in the tower as possible during the event.</p>

    <h3>6. Team Morale</h3>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Obtain Hero Soul Stones to earn Harunian Brew.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Team Morale</strong> quest chain rewards players for collecting Hero Soul Stones. These are essential for upgrading heroes. Make sure to focus on obtaining soul stones through campaign missions and events during the festival.</p>

    <h3>7. Incredible Tenacity</h3>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Spend energy to receive Harunian Brew.</p>
    <p>Energy is used for completing campaign missions. The <strong>Incredible Tenacity</strong> quest chain rewards players for spending energy. To optimize this, spend energy wisely on quests that offer soul stones for your characters.</p>

    <h3>8. Trade Route</h3>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Start Valkyrie's Expeditions to gain Harunian Brew.</p>
<p>The <strong>Trade Route</strong> quest chain rewards players for initiating Valkyrie's Expeditions, offering opportunities to collect Harunian Brew. Expeditions are a valuable feature in <strong>Hero Wars Alliance</strong>, providing players with resources and rewards. Completing these expeditions during the Autumn Festival is a great way to maximize your rewards and enhance your heroes' strength.</p>

    <h2>Autumn Festival Reward Breakdown</h2>
