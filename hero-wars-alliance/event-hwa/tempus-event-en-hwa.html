<h2>Dark Carnival in Hero Wars: New Hero Tempus</h2>

<p>Hello, everyone! Welcome to <strong>Alexandre Games</strong>, where we bring you the latest tips and updates from the gaming world! In today's post, we're diving into the <strong>Dark Carnival</strong> event, which celebrates the arrival of the new hero <strong>Tempus</strong> in <em>Hero Wars Alliance</em>. This event is packed with missions and rewards that will help you evolve Tempus and strengthen your team.</p>


<h2>The New Hero: Tempus</h2>

<p><strong>Tempus</strong> has made a strong entrance, quickly becoming one of the top heroes in <em>Hero Wars</em>. Many players are placing him at the top of tier lists, ranking him as an <strong>S</strong> or even <strong>S+</strong> hero. He excels in battles, thanks to his magical powers and time-controlling abilities.</p>

<p>Compared to recent heroes like <strong>Folio</strong> and <strong>Soleil</strong>, Tempus seems to be a step ahead, offering more effective options for both offense and defense. While it's still early to make a definitive judgment, Tempus has already proven to be a powerful and versatile hero.</p>

<h3>Tempus Skins</h3>

<p>Tempus comes with two available skins:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Default Skin</strong> – Increases his magic attack and magic defense, which is crucial for boosting his abilities.</li>
  <li><strong>Stellar Skin</strong> – An even more powerful skin, but it's only available by completing missions in the Season Pass.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, let's jump into the <strong>Dark Carnival</strong>, the event that marks Tempus's arrival and gives players 28 days to unlock the best rewards and evolve him.</p>

<h2>The Event: Dark Carnival</h2>

<p>The <strong>Dark Carnival</strong> event is split into two stages, each lasting 14 days, giving players a total of <strong>28 days</strong> to complete all missions and obtain <strong>Tempus</strong> with at least five stars. Below are the key missions in the event:</p>

<h3>1. Daily Login Mission</h3>
<p>This is simple: log in every day to earn <strong>Adventure Energy</strong>, which you’ll use for other missions.</p>

<h3>2. Defeat Bandits</h3>
<p>Take down bandits in the <strong>Raiders’ Store</strong> map to earn more Adventure Energy. It’s an easy mission that you can repeat daily.</p>

<h3>3. Open Tower Chests</h3>
<p>Open chests in the <strong>Tower</strong> to receive <strong>Adventure Energy</strong>. If you have extra Emeralds, it’s worth opening as many chests as possible at once to maximize your rewards.</p>

<h3>4. Arena Battles</h3>
<p>Fight in the <strong>Arena</strong> to earn <strong>Tempus Coins</strong>. Don't confuse these with <strong>Tempus Energy</strong>: the coins are used to purchase items in the event store.</p>

<h3>5. Open Outland Chests</h3>
<p>Open chests in the <strong>Outland</strong> every day. Ideally, you should open at least 8 chests daily (the 5 free ones plus 3 more at a discount) to maximize your rewards.</p>

<h3>6. Spend Energy and Emeralds</h3>
<p>Every time you spend <strong>Energy</strong> or <strong>Emeralds</strong>, you’ll also earn <strong>Tempus Coins</strong>, which can be used in the event shop to buy key items.</p>

<h3>7. Earn VIP Points</h3>
<p>This mission is for those looking to invest a bit more in the game. Spending real money to earn VIP points will also reward you with Tempus Coins.</p>

<h2>Tips for Progressing in the Event</h2>

<p>The <strong>Path to Greatness</strong> event is where you’ll level up Tempus and earn great rewards over the 28 days. Here are some essential tips:</p>

<h3>1. Wisdom Path: Upgrading Skins</h3>
<p>As you upgrade <strong>Tempus’s basic and Stellar skins</strong>, you’ll earn intelligence stones as rewards. These are essential for improving Tempus's magic attack, which directly boosts his overall combat effectiveness.</p>
<p>Aim to level up his skins to at least level 160. The higher you go, the more intelligence and rewards you’ll earn, helping Tempus scale well in battle.</p>

<h3>2. Blacksmith’s Mastery: Enhancing Artifacts</h3>
<p>In this mission, the goal is to level up <strong>Tempus’s artifacts</strong>. The more you invest in his artifacts, the higher the quality of the rewards, including <strong>artifact chests</strong> and higher-level materials.</p>
<p>Prioritize upgrading his key artifacts, focusing first on <strong>Intelligence</strong> and <strong>Armor</strong> artifacts to make him more durable, especially as a front-line hero.</p>

<h3>3. Artifact Awakening</h3>
<p>To fully unlock Tempus’s potential, evolving any of his artifacts to a higher star level will grant you rewards like <strong>Chaos Cores</strong>, <strong>Artifact Tomes</strong>, and even rare <strong>rings</strong>.</p>
<p>Focus on upgrading <strong>Tempus’s Talisman</strong>—this provides him with <strong>intelligence and armor</strong>, making it one of the most crucial items for his long-term viability in your team.</p>

<h3>4. Daily Growth: Leveling Tempus</h3>
<p>Every time you increase <strong>Tempus’s hero level</strong>, you will receive <strong>XP potions</strong> and other helpful resources. This daily mission resets, so make sure to invest in Tempus’s growth consistently to get the most out of it.</p>
<p>As Tempus levels up, his stats, including magic attack and health, will improve, making him a valuable asset in battles, especially when combined with strong support heroes.</p>

<h3>5. Glyphs Upgrade</h3>
<p>In the <strong>Glyphs</strong> mission, you’ll use <strong>Rune Stones</strong> to upgrade Tempus’s glyphs. While you won’t get 100% of your investment back, you’ll earn a portion of the resources, which helps reduce the cost of upgrading his key stats.</p>
<p>Prioritize glyphs that boost <strong>magic attack</strong>, <strong>health</strong>, and <strong>armor</strong>—these are critical for Tempus to thrive in his role as a front-line, magic-wielding hero.</p>

<h3>6. Elemental Gift</h3>
<p>In this mission, you’ll enhance Tempus’s <strong>Elemental Gifts</strong>, which provide bonuses to his stats and abilities. By upgrading these, you’ll receive <strong>Sparks of Power</strong> as a reward, giving you the resources to further improve his elemental abilities.</p>

<h3>7. Greatness Triumph: Completing Event Missions</h3>
<p>Completing the <strong>Path to Greatness</strong> missions rewards you with <strong>Rune Spheres</strong>, which are used to upgrade Tempus’s glyphs. Make sure to participate in all the missions to accumulate these valuable resources.</p>

<h2>Hero Fights and Tempus’s Battle Performance</h2>

<p>During the <strong>Dark Carnival</strong>, you’ll also be able to test Tempus’s strength in special <strong>Hero Fights</strong>. These battles will let you see how Tempus performs in combat with different team compositions, allowing you to refine your strategy.</p>



<h3>Best Team Compositions for Tempus</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Iris</strong> – Has synergy with Tempus' abilities, and this buff synergy makes them a lethal combo in Hero Wars Alliance.</li>
  <li><strong>Morrigan</strong> – Supports Tempus with healing and damage buffs, helping keep him alive in the front lines.</li>
  <li><strong>Nebula</strong> – Enhances Tempus’s magic attack with her boosts, making him more lethal.</li>
  <li><strong>Dante</strong> – Protects Tempus from high burst damage while helping control enemy movement.</li>
</ul>



<p>Testing different team compositions in <strong>Hero Fights</strong> during the event will give you a good idea of how Tempus synergizes with your roster. His abilities to control time and deal high magical damage make him a versatile option in a variety of team setups.</p>

<h2>Tempus’s Event Store: What to Buy</h2>

<p>As you progress in the <strong>Dark Carnival</strong>, you’ll earn <strong>Tempus Coins</strong> and <strong>Carnival Tickets</strong> that can be spent in the event store. Here's a breakdown of the best items to focus on:</p>

<h3>1. Talisman of Eternity</h3>
<p>This is Tempus’s most critical item. It provides him with <strong>intelligence and armor</strong>, which are essential for his survival on the front lines. Prioritize purchasing this as soon as you unlock it.</p>

<h3>2. Tempus’s Soul Stones</h3>
<p>You’ll need these to evolve Tempus to five or six stars. These stones will help you strengthen him quickly, especially if you’re a Free-to-Play player. Buying these early will ensure you have a strong Tempus by the end of the event.</p>

<h3>3. Tempus’s Weapon Artifact</h3>
<p>Once you have the Talisman and Soul Stones, consider investing in Tempus’s weapon artifact. This will help boost his magic attack further, giving him even more power in battle.</p>

<h3>4. Energy</h3>
<p>If you’re struggling to complete missions or progress in the campaign, you can also spend coins on <strong>energy</strong> to keep advancing.</p>

<h3>Free-to-Play Strategy</h3>
<p>If you’re not planning on spending real money in the game, the best approach is to <strong>save up your resources</strong> for the most important items. Focus on reaching level 23 in the <strong>Carnival Store</strong> to buy the <strong>Talisman of Eternity</strong>. Without it, Tempus will be much weaker in battles.</p>

<p>Only spend <strong>Tempus Coins</strong> on the Talisman, Soul Stones, and his weapon artifact. Avoid buying less essential items like potions or lower-tier gear, as these can be obtained more easily outside of the event.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The <strong>Dark Carnival</strong> event is a great opportunity to add a powerful new hero to your roster. <strong>Tempus</strong> stands out with his ability to control time and deal massive magic damage, making him an asset in both PvE and PvP. If you follow the strategies laid out in this guide, you’ll be well on your way to unlocking his full potential and maximizing the rewards from this event.</p>

<p>That’s all for today’s post about <strong>Tempus</strong> and the <strong>Dark Carnival</strong> event. I hope this guide helps you navigate the event and strengthen your hero lineup. Don't forget to share your thoughts in the comments below.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for the next video, where I’ll dive into a full <strong>Tempus guide</strong>, covering his abilities and best synergies. Thanks for reading, and see you next time!</p>
