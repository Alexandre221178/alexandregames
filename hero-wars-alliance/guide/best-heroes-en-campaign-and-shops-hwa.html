        <h2>Understanding the Basics of Hero Investment</h2>
        <p>
            Before delving into specific heroes, it’s essential to understand the general principles of hero 
            investment in Hero Wars. Your hero investments should align with your overall strategy, considering 
            factors like the type of enemies you’re facing, your team’s composition, and the resources available 
            to you.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Factors to Consider:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Hero Roles: Tanks, Damage Dealers, Supports, and Healers.</li>
            <li>Synergy: How well heroes work together.</li>
            <li>Faction: Different factions offer unique bonuses and synergies.</li>
            <li>Campaign Progression: Some heroes excel in the campaign, while others shine in PvP or guild-related activities like the Hydra.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Campaign Heroes: Where to Start</h2>

        <div class="hero-tierlist">
            <h3>Artemis: A Strong Honor Faction Hero</h3>
            <a href="../../Hero Wars/Guia de Heróis Hero Wars/Artemis - English.html">
                <img src="../../img-HWM/Artemis-img/artemis300x260.webp" alt="Artemis in Hero Wars Alliance" title="Artemis Hero Wars Mobile">
            </a>
            <h4>Role: Marksman</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Faction: Honor</li>
                <li>Why Invest: Artemis is a solid investment for the Honor faction, though you won’t unlock her immediately. Once available, start farming her soul stones, as she’s an excellent damage dealer who works well in both PvE and PvP. Her strength grows steadily, making her a valuable addition to your team.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="hero-tierlist">
            <h3>Astaroth: Your Go-To Tank</h3>
            <a href="../../Hero Wars/Guia de Heróis Hero Wars/Astaroth - English.html">
                <img src="../../img-HWM/Astaroth-img/Astaroth300x260.webp" alt="Astaroth in Hero Wars Alliance" title="Astaroth Hero Wars Mobile">
            </a>
            <h4>Role: Tank</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Faction: Chaos</li>
                <li>Why Invest: Astaroth is often the first tank you'll encounter in the campaign, and he’s worth every resource. His skill set is built around protecting your team, making him an excellent choice for beginners. He can resurrect an ally, effectively giving you a sixth hero in battles. This ability is powerful, though it’s countered by Morrigan, who can prevent resurrections. Still, Astaroth remains a strong, reliable tank and should be one of your first investments.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="hero-tierlist">
            <h3>Ginger: The Progress Hero</h3>
            <a href="../../Hero Wars/Guia de Heróis Hero Wars/Ginger - English.html">
                <img src="../../img-HWM/Ginger-img/ginger-300x260.webp" alt="Ginger in Hero Wars Alliance" title="Ginger Hero Wars Mobile">
            </a>
            <h4>Role: Damage Dealer</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Faction: Progress</li>
                <li>Why Invest: Once considered a subpar choice, Ginger has seen a resurgence thanks to her utility in the Progress faction. With strong area-of-effect (AoE) damage, Ginger can help you clear campaign levels faster. Between Ginger and Keira, Ginger is often the better choice for new players focusing on the Progress faction.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="hero-tierlist">
            <h3>Helios: The Critical Damage Counter</h3>
            <a href="../../Hero Wars/Guia de Heróis Hero Wars/Helios - English.html">
                <img src="../../img-HWM/Helios-img/helios-300x260.webp" alt="Helios in Hero Wars Alliance" title="Helios Hero Wars Mobile">
            </a>
            <h4>Role: Support</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Faction: Honor</li>
                <li>Why Invest: Helios is great for countering critical damage teams, making him a top pick when facing crit-heavy opponents. If you often encounter such teams, investing in Helios can provide strong defensive capabilities and improve your team’s survivability.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="hero-tierlist">
            <h3>Keira: A Solid Alternative</h3>
            <a href="../../Hero Wars/Guia de Heróis Hero Wars/Keira - English.html">
                <img src="../../img-HWM/Keira-img/keira-300x260.webp" alt="Keira in Hero Wars Alliance" title="Keira Hero Wars Mobile">
            </a>
            <h4>Role: Damage Dealer</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Faction: Eternity</li>
                <li>Why Invest: Keira is another viable early-game hero. Although Ginger might be more beneficial for a Progress-focused team, Keira is still strong, particularly when paired with heroes from the Eternity faction like Iris and Dante. If you lean towards an Eternity team, Keira is a good investment.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="hero-tierlist">
            <h3>Phobos: The Mage Counter</h3>
            <a href="../../Hero Wars/Guia de Heróis Hero Wars/Phobos - English.html">
                <img src="../../img-HWM/Phobos-img/phobos-300x260.webp" alt="Phobos in Hero Wars Alliance" title="Phobos Hero Wars Mobile">
            </a>
            <h4>Role: Control</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Faction: Eternity</li>
                <li>Why Invest: Phobos is an excellent counter to mage-heavy teams. His ability to control and disable enemy mages makes him a valuable asset in both campaign and PvP. Compared to Cornelius, Phobos is currently the stronger choice, especially in the Eternity faction.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="hero-tierlist">
            <h3>Heidi: The Pure Damage Specialist</h3>
            <a href="../../Hero Wars/Guia de Heróis Hero Wars/heidi-english.html">
                <img src="../../img-HWM/Heidi-img/heidi300x260.webp" alt="Heidi in Hero Wars Alliance" title="Heidi Hero Wars Mobile">
            </a>
            <h4>Role: Damage Dealer</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Faction: Nature</li>
                <li>Why Invest: Heidi is highly valued for his pure damage output, which bypasses dodge mechanics. This makes him a great counter to heroes like Dante, Octavia and teams built around dodge abilities. Heidi’s role as a pure damage dealer makes him indispensable in certain matchups.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="hero-tierlist">
            <h3>Mojo: The Best for Campaign and Hydra</h3>
            <a href="../../Hero Wars/Guia de Heróis Hero Wars/Mojo - English.html">
                <img src="../../img-HWM/Mojo-img/mojo-300x260.webp" alt="Mojo in Hero Wars Alliance" title="Mojo Hero Wars Mobile">
            </a>
            <h4>Role: Damage Dealer, Healer</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Faction: Nature</li>
                <li>Why Invest: Mojo is highly effective for Hydra battles when paired with Jhu. Even at just three stars, both can contribute greatly to your guild. As they level up, their damage increases, and they can eventually deal significant damage to even Legendary Hydras without needing to be fully maxed out.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Campaign Heroes to Avoid (For Now)</h2>
        <p>While some heroes might seem appealing, they may not be worth your resources early on. Here’s a quick rundown of who to avoid:</p>
        
        <div class="hero-tierlist">
            <h3>Aurora and Galahad: Overrated Tanks</h3>
            <a href="../../Hero Wars/Guia de Heróis Hero Wars/Aurora - English.html">
                <img src="../../img-HWM/Aurora-img/aurora-300x260.webp" alt="Aurora and Galahad in Hero Wars Alliance" title="Aurora and Galahad Hero Wars Mobile">
            </a>
            <h4>Why Avoid:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Although they appear early and might seem like good tanks, Astaroth is generally a better investment. Both Aurora and Galahad require significant investment to be effective, which might not be feasible early in the game.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="hero-tierlist">
            <h3>Fox: Wait for a Rework</h3>
            <a href="../../Hero Wars/Guia de Heróis Hero Wars/fox-herowars.html">
                <img src="../../img-HWM/fox-img/fox300x260.webp" alt="Fox in Hero Wars Alliance" title="Fox Hero Wars Mobile">
            </a>
            <h4>Why Avoid:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fox doesn’t bring enough to the table compared to other heroes. Unless Fox receives a rework or significant buffs, it’s better to focus on other damage dealers.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="hero-tierlist">
            <h3>Krista and Lars: Outdated Duo</h3>
            <a href="../../Hero Wars/Guia de Heróis Hero Wars/Krista - English.html">
                <img src="../../img-HWM/Krista-img/krista-300x260.webp" alt="Krista and Lars in Hero Wars Alliance" title="Krista and Lars Hero Wars Mobile">
            </a>
            <h4>Why Avoid:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Once popular, Krista and Lars have lost their edge with the introduction of newer heroes like Kayla and Aidan. If you're considering a Chaos team, it’s better to invest in these newer options.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Merchant: Where to Spend Your Currency</h2>
        <p>
            As you progress, you'll earn currency from various shops. Deciding where to spend this currency is crucial, 
            as it can significantly impact your team's strength.
        </p>


        <div class="hero-tierlist">

            <h3>Dorian:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Dorian's vampirism ability makes him a valuable support hero, even at low star levels. You don't need to max him out his utility lies in his ability to grant vampirism to allies, which continues to work even after he dies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Andvari:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid spending on Andvari in the VIP shop. While he's highly effective against K'arkh teams, there are other counters available. Additionally, with the introduction of the tank class, Andvari has lost his value as a makeshift tank due to being a warrior. He also can't defeat K'arkh teams alone and requires a second tank.</li>

            <h3>Extra Tip:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Invest in Astaroth as a tank for the Progress faction while you work on obtaining Julius. Julius is the best tank for this faction, but his soul stones are hard to come by.</li>

                    In the Highwaymen Shop, the best purchase is Faceless, a hero who fits into any team and has great synergy, blending well with both physical and mage teams, in addition to copying the enemy's ultimate abilities.

                <li>The Outland Shop offers various hero soul stones, but it's often better to wait for events where you can earn them more efficiently.

        <div class="hero-tierlist">
            <h3>Titan Potions First</h3>
           
            <h4>Why:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>When starting out, prioritize buying Titan Potions. Titans play a crucial role in guild activities, and leveling them up early can give you a significant advantage.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Focus on Skins and Dust Later</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Once your Titans are at a decent level, shift your focus to purchasing Titan skins and fairy dust. These items will help you enhance your Titans further, giving you a stronger edge in battles.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>While Jet is a formidable hero, farming his soul stones in the Soul Stones Shop is excessively expensive, especially if you’re a free-to-play (F2P) player or someone who spends minimally on the game. Currently, Jet isn’t performing well enough to justify the high cost, offering too little for the investment. As an F2P or low-spending player, avoiding Jet should be a priority.</li>

                    <li>
                        Additionally, consider investing in EXP potions to quickly level up your heroes, providing a faster boost to your team’s overall power. Then, focus on purchasing orange equipment items to strengthen your main team.

            <p>
                As a beginner, managing your Hydra Coins can be tricky. Here's some advice:

            <a href="../../Hero Wars/Guia de Heróis Hero Wars/Yasmine - English.html">

            <h3>Yasmine:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A top-tier assassin, Yasmine excels in critical damage teams. Investing in her can give you a powerful edge in both PvP and PvE content.</li>

            <h3>Morrigan:</h3>
            <ul>

            <h3>Tristan and Xe'sha:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Tristan and Xe'sha are excellent heroes to purchase, but the scarcity of Hero's Way coins and the abundance of useful items available make them a difficult choice for beginners, as they must decide between resources or their soul stones.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Focus on Essential Purchases:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The Hero's Way Shop offers rare resources, but they come at a high cost. Prioritize upgrading your heroes' star levels and only purchase items that will provide immediate, significant benefits.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Final Thoughts and Strategy Summary</h2>
        <p>
            As you progress through Hero Wars Alliance, your hero investments will shape your overall success. By 
            focusing on key heroes from both the campaign and various shops, you can build a well-rounded team 
            capable of tackling the game's many challenges.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Start with Astaroth: He’s your best bet for an early-game tank.</li>
            <li>Ginger over Keira: Focus on Progress heroes early on.</li>
            <li>Be selective in shop investments: Don’t spread your resources too thin; focus on heroes that will provide the most value to your team composition.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember, the choices you make now will have long-term effects on your gameplay. Choose wisely, and good luck!</p>
