<h2 id="understanding-dungeon">1. Understanding the Dungeon and Titanite in Hero Wars Alliance</h2>

<p>The <strong>Dungeon</strong> in Hero Wars is a key area where players can receive various rewards critical for progressing in the game. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Titan Potions:</strong> Used to level up your Titans, increasing their power and effectiveness in battles.</li>
  <li><strong>Soul Stone Fragments:</strong> Collected to increase the star level of your Titans, boosting their overall stats and capabilities.</li>
  <li><strong>Gold:</strong> An essential resource used to upgrade both Titans' and Heroes' equipment, allowing for better performance in battles.</li>
</ul>

    <figcaption>Dungeon Rewards in Hero Wars Alliance</figcaption>

<p><strong>Titanite</strong> is particularly important in the Dungeon as it allows players to earn <strong>Summoning Spheres</strong>, which are used to summon Titans. The collection of titanite is limited to a specific amount per day for each player, with the potential for extra titanite through the activity of guild members within the Dungeon.</p>

<p>As you progress through the Dungeon, the enemies you face become progressively stronger, requiring strategic planning and a carefully built team of Titans to succeed at higher levels. It's crucial to focus on gathering these resources consistently to improve your Titans and advance through the Dungeon effectively.</p>

<h2 id="prioritizing-titans">2. Prioritizing Titan Upgrades: Which Titans to Focus On</h2>

<p>As you begin your journey in the Dungeon, your top focus should be upgrading your Titans. Rather than leveling all of them equally, it's essential to take a more selective approach. Prioritize Titans strategically, advancing them step by step according to their roles and the strength of their elements: Earth first, then Water, and finally Fire.</p>

<p><strong>Upgrading your Titans</strong> should be your top priority. However, not all Titans should be upgraded equally. Instead, focus on <strong>gradual and strategic leveling</strong> based on their roles and elements. Here’s how to approach it:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Primary Titans</strong> for the Dungeon include <strong>Earth</strong>, <strong>Water</strong>, and <strong>Fire Titans</strong>, in that order. The <strong>Earth Titan</strong> should always be your strongest Titan, followed by Water, and lastly Fire. This is because of the matchups you will face in the Dungeon.</li>
    <li><strong>Earth &gt; Water &gt; Fire</strong> – Your Earth Titans need to be stronger for you to get more battles against Water Titans vs Fire Titans, as Water counters Fire effectively. In the Dungeon, Water Titans often include <strong>Hyperion</strong> and <strong>Sigurd</strong>, who possess powerful healing abilities, making them nearly invincible. These Titans can end battles with full health thanks to their strong healing, which is why it's crucial to strengthen your Earth Titans to gain the upper hand.</li>
    <li><strong>Energy management</strong> – Another important aspect is managing your Titans' energy in each battle room of the Dungeon. Try to save energy for the next fight whenever possible. For beginners, playing in manual mode is recommended, as it allows better control of energy management and overall strategy.</li>
    <li>For beginners, <strong>Iyari</strong> (a new Light Titan) should be prioritized among the newer Titans. It’s best to use her after your main Titans have weakened, as she can help push a bit further in difficult levels. <strong>Solaris</strong> is another new Titan to consider because of her healing artifact, but she won’t perform miracles in the Dungeon older Titans still reign supreme.</li>
</ul>

<p>By focusing on upgrading the most important Titans first and utilizing your resources wisely, you can ensure steady progression and increase your chances of success in the Dungeon.</p>

<h2 id="earning-gold">3. Efficient Gold Earning Strategy</h2>

<p>As you progress, your goal is to <strong>accumulate as much gold as possible</strong>. Earning infinite gold requires advancing to higher levels in the Dungeon, where the rewards are greater. Here are key steps to earning gold efficiently:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Focus on leveling Titans</strong> with Titan potions rather than spend gold directly. Stronger Titans will allow you to progress further into the Dungeon, where gold rewards are higher.</li>
    <li>Early on, aim to <strong>complete daily titanite quests</strong>. Collecting at least 300 titanite during special events or 150 titanite on regular days should be your initial target.</li>
    <li>As your Titans become stronger and you reach higher Dungeon levels, you’ll be able to earn larger sums of gold, potentially reaching <strong>millions of gold</strong> per day once your team is optimized.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="managing-resources">4. Managing Resources: Potions and Artifacts</h2>

<p>Managing your <strong>Titan potions</strong> and artifacts is crucial for consistent progress in the Dungeon. Here’s how to do it effectively:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Titan Potions</strong>: Use these to level up your Titans gradually, starting with your priority Titans (Earth, Water, and Fire Titans). Avoid spreading your potions across too many Titans at once; instead, focus on the core team that will help you progress through the Dungeon.</li>
    <li><strong>Artifacts</strong>: Prioritize the <strong>weapon artifact</strong> for key Titans like <strong>Angus</strong> (an Earth Titan) and <strong>Sigurd</strong>. Angus is particularly important because of his high damage output, which can carry you through early Dungeon levels. Once their weapon artifacts reach level six (maximum), they will significantly enhance your progress.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="advanced-strategies">5. Advanced Strategies for Deeper Dungeon Levels</h2>

<p>As you advance to deeper Dungeon levels, the enemies you face will become significantly stronger. It’s important to focus on two key areas: <strong>tank strength</strong> and <strong>healing capabilities</strong>.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Tank Titans</strong>: <strong>Angus</strong> and <strong>Sigurd</strong> are your primary tanks. Initially, focus on <strong>Angus</strong> as he has higher damage output early in the game, while Sigurd becomes more useful later when his healing ability improves through artifact upgrades.</li>
    <li><strong>Healing Titans</strong>: <strong>Hyperion</strong> and <strong>Avalon</strong> are essential healers for your team. <strong>Hyperion</strong> has both healing abilities and a healing artifact, making him indispensable. Avalon’s shield provides additional protection, which is critical in the later stages of the Dungeon.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="titan-lineups">6. Titan Lineups: Which Elements to Prioritize</h2>

<p>To optimize your lineup for the Dungeon, you should:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Focus on building a team with <strong>Earth, Water, and Fire Titans</strong>, with Earth Titans being the strongest in your lineup.</li>
    <li>As mentioned earlier, prioritize <strong>Earth &gt; Water &gt; Fire</strong>. <strong>Moloch</strong> (Fire Titan) becomes useful only after reaching higher power levels, so don’t focus too much on him early on.</li>
    <li>Use the synergy between Titans like <strong>Araji</strong> and <strong>Ignis</strong>. Araji’s high damage output combined with Ignis’s buff makes them a formidable duo, allowing you to push further into the Dungeon.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="key-skills">7. Key Titan Skills and Artifacts for Dungeon Success</h2>

<p>Understanding how to use your Titan’s skills and artifacts will help you conquer difficult Dungeon levels:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Araji</strong>: A strong damage dealer with a powerful ultimate skill. Use <strong>Ignis’s buff</strong> to boost Araji’s damage output, especially when facing tough opponents.</li>
    <li><strong>Sigurd</strong>: Prioritize his <strong>artifact weapon</strong> to improve his healing ability. Once upgraded, he becomes invaluable for sustaining your team through difficult fights with his invincible shield and healing.</li>
    <li><strong>Hyperion</strong>: Focus on increasing his <strong>attack power</strong> through skins and artifacts. His passive healing ability scales with attack power, making him the best healer for your team.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="optimize-for-gold">8. How to Optimize for Gold and Titanite Collection</h2>

<p>By following these strategies, you can maximize your <strong>gold and titanite</strong> collection in the Dungeon:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Daily Goals</strong>: Aim for consistent progress. Early on, collect at least 300 titanite during special events, or aim for 150 titanite on regular days.</li>
    <li>As your Titans grow stronger, you’ll be able to earn more titanite, and with that, more <strong>gold</strong>. With a powerful team, you can eventually earn <strong>millions of gold daily</strong>, especially once you consistently reach higher Dungeon levels.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">9. Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>By following this guide and steadily improving your Titans, you’ll be able to <strong>conquer the Dungeon</strong>, collect a massive amount of titanite, and accumulate infinite gold in <strong>Hero Wars</strong>. Remember that progress takes time, so be patient, focus on the right upgrades, and prioritize the strongest Titans for the Dungeon.</p>

<p>The strategies outlined here have been tested and refined by top players, and if you stick to them, you’ll see great results over time.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading! Be sure to follow these tips, and don’t forget to share this guide with your guildmates for even more success in Hero Wars Mobile.</p>
