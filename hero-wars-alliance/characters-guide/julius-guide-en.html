<h3>Mimicry Device:</h3>

This ensures additional protection for the entire team, making Julius even more formidable in prolonged combat.</p>

<h3>Nine Lives Engine:</h3>
<p>Whenever a shield is destroyed on Julius or an ally, they gain bonus armor and magic defense, while all debuffs are removed. This ability is crucial for keeping the team resilient against enemy attacks and ensuring their survival during the most intense battles.</p>





<h3>Perfect Reflexes:</h3>
<p>This ability passively increases the speed of attacks and abilities for all allies protected by a shield. The bonus is even greater for Progress heroes, significantly enhancing Julius's team effectiveness in combat.</p>

<h2>Playing Strategies with Julius:</h2>

    <li><strong>Effect per Strength Point:</strong>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Physical Attack Increase:</strong> +2000 points</li>

    <li><strong>Total Armor Penetration Increase:</strong> +19,800 points (across 3 slots)</li>

<h3>Julius Talisman of Paw-Sitivity Overall Impact</h3>
<p>Equipping Julius with the talisman of Paw-Sitivity, Hero Wars Mobile. dramatically enhances his combat effectiveness. The 2000-point increase in strength translates to significant gains in both physical attack and health, improving his offensive and defensive capabilities. Additionally, the three armor penetration slots, each providing 6600 points, ensure that Julius can effectively counter armored enemies, making him a formidable force on the battlefield.</p>


<h4>Julius' Second Talisman in Hero Wars Alliance: Physical Attack and Toughness Power</h4>
<p>
Julius’ second Talisman in Hero Wars Alliance significantly boosts his survivability and damage potential, making him even more reliable as a front-line tank. This Talisman provides Julius with one slot that grants an impressive +8000 Physical Attack, enhancing the effectiveness of his basic attacks and skills. In addition to this offensive upgrade, Julius gains three rerollable slots dedicated to the Toughness stat, each capable of reaching up to +2200 with the right enhancements.
</p>
<p>
Toughness is a powerful defensive stat that reduces all incoming damage types physical, magical, and pure when Julius' health is low. It is especially valuable in critical moments of battle, where a slight damage reduction can mean the difference between life and defeat. The only exception is damage caused by ally abilities that reduce HP, which is not mitigated by Toughness.
</p>
<p>
The effectiveness of Toughness is calculated using the formula: <strong>(Toughness / (Toughness + enemy’s main stat)) × 100%</strong>. This makes it a scaling defensive stat, where higher values offer increasingly stronger protection. With rerolls pushing each slot to +2200, Julius can reach up to +6600 Toughness, granting substantial resistance when under pressure.
</p>
<p>
Overall, Julius’ second Talisman makes him a hybrid powerhouse, increasing both his damage output and his durability. It’s a must-have upgrade for players looking to maximize his utility in both offense and defense.
