      <h4>Talisman of Mycelium Overall Impact</h4>
      <p>With the Talisman of Mushy and Shroom, Mushy becomes a formidable tank with increased armor and intelligence. The enhanced magic attack boosts the effectiveness of his abilities, making him a dual threat on the battlefield. The additional strength of the Shroom clone further solidifies Mushy's position as a unique and powerful tank in Hero Wars Alliance.</p>


      <h3>How Mushy and Shroom's Talisman of Fungi Enhances Their Tanking and Magical Power</h3>
      <p>
      Mushy is the only tank in Hero Wars Alliance with mage stats including Intelligence as the main stat, mage glyphs, and mage artifacts. His abilities scale mainly with health and partly with magic attack.
      </p>
      <p>
      With their Talisman of Fungi, Mushy and Shroom receive one slot with +4000 Magical Critical Hit Chance and three slots of Toughness, each of which can be rerolled up to +2200.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Magical Critical Hit Chance:</strong><br>
      🔸 Grants the Hero a chance to deal increased magical damage. Activates only when dealing magical damage.<br>
      🔸 Magical critical damage is 2.5× stronger than regular damage.<br>
      🔸 Works just like regular Critical Hit Chance, using the formula: (Magical Crit Chance / (Magical Crit Chance + enemy’s main stat)) × 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Toughness:</strong><br>
      🔸 Reduces all incoming damage when the Hero’s health is low.<br>
      🔸 Applies to physical, magical, and pure damage but not health lost from allied abilities.<br>
      🔸 The damage reduction formula is: (Toughness / (Toughness + enemy’s main stat)) × 100%.
      </p>

      <h4>Overall Impact of Mushy and Shroom's Second Talisman</h4>
      <p>
      The second talisman significantly enhances Mushy and Shroom’s dual role as both a durable frontline tank and a magical damage dealer. The added Magical Critical Hit Chance boosts their offensive capabilities, allowing for explosive magical damage bursts, while the Toughness slots improve survivability during critical moments in battle. This combination makes them more reliable in long fights and harder to take down, especially against teams that rely on burst damage.
