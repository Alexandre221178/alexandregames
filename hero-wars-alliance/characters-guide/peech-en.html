<h2>Meet Peech: The Grand Spectacle of Battle</h2>
<div class="content-wrapper">

  <p>Hey there, Hero Wars fans! Alexandre here, and today we’re diving into the dazzling world of <strong>Peech</strong>, the newest addition to the Hero Wars Alliance roster. If you’re looking for a hero who can turn every battle into a grand spectacle, Peech is your girl. She’s a star who shines brighter the longer the fight goes on, and trust me, you’re going to want her on your team.</p>
 
</div>


  <div class="content-wrapper">
    <p>At first glance, Peech might seem a bit fragile, but don’t let that fool you. She is a <strong>Warrior</strong> whose main stat is <strong>Agility</strong>, making her a swift and precise damage dealer. As a member of the <strong>Way of Chaos</strong> faction, her abilities grow stronger as the battle progresses. Let’s break down everything you need to know about Peech, from her skills to her synergies with other heroes.</p>

    <h2>Peech’s Skills: A Showstopper in Every Sense</h2>
    <p>Peech’s abilities are as flashy as they are effective. Here’s a rundown of what she brings to the battlefield:</p>

<!-- Anuncio Google ADX -->
  
  


  <h3>Theater of Pain</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Knockback, Control</strong><br>
    Damage per strike: (60% Phys. atk. + 4800)<br>
    Peech strikes the nearest enemy 3 times. Each strike deals physical area damage and slightly pushes back the affected enemies. This is great for controlling the battlefield and keeping enemies at a distance.<br>
    <strong>Passive Effect:</strong> Peech increases the range of her basic attacks and the area of effect of her basic attacks and first skill by 25% for each Chaos ally she starts the battle with. This means the more Chaos allies you have, the stronger and wider her attacks become!
  </p>
  
  <h3>Harlequin's Punishment</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Buff, Debuff</strong><br>
    Damage: (50% Phys. atk. + 8400)<br>
    Armor reduction: 50%<br>
    Physical or Magic attack increase: 50% of the target's Armor<br>
    Peech deals physical damage to the enemy with the highest Armor. Then, for 9 seconds, she reduces the target's Armor and increases the Physical or Magic attack of all allies whose Intelligence is higher than the target's. The boost depends on the target's current Armor.<br>
    <strong>Bonus:</strong> Allies gain a boost to the stat (Physical or Magic attack) that was higher at the start of the battle. This makes your team hit even harder!
  </p>
  
  <h3>The Final Act</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Debuff</strong><br>
  Physical attack steal: (15% Phys. atk. + 1800) every 0.5 seconds<br>
  Peech links herself to the enemy with the highest Physical attack for 6 seconds. During this time, the target cannot move, and Peech steals a portion of their Physical attack every 0.5 seconds. Since the effect lasts 6 seconds and she steals every 0.5 seconds, she will steal a total of <strong>12 times</strong> during this period!<br>
  She keeps the stolen Physical attack for 6 seconds after the effect ends or is interrupted.<br>
  <strong>Note:</strong> This ability doesn’t stop the enemy from fighting, but it’s interrupted if Peech is hit by a control effect (like stun or freeze).
</p>
  
  <h3>Stage Presence</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Passive Skill</strong><br>
    Damage bonus per ally: (15% Phys. atk. + 1200)<br>
    Damage bonus per Chaos ally: 11636 (15% Phys. atk. + 2400)<br>
    This is a passive skill, meaning it’s always active. Each ally positioned in front of Peech at the moment of her attack increases all damage she deals. If the ally belongs to the Chaos faction, the bonus is even bigger!<br>
    <strong>Important:</strong> Only the allies Peech starts the battle with are counted for this bonus. Heroes like <a href="../../Hero Wars/Guia de Heróis Hero Wars/ninja-turtles-hwa-en.html">Ninja Turtles</a>, who join the fight after the battle has started, do not count. So, choose your team wisely!
</p></section>

    <h2>Artifacts: Prioritizing Peech’s Power</h2>
    <p>To get the most out of Peech, you’ll want to focus on upgrading her artifacts in the following order:</p>

    <h3>1. Heartbreaker (Armor)</h3>
    <p>This should be your first priority. Increasing Peech’s Armor will make her more durable, allowing her to stay in the fight longer and continue building her strength.</p>

    <h3>2. Alchemist's Folio (Armor Penetration + Physical Attack)</h3>
    <p>Next up is the Alchemist's Folio. Boosting Peech’s Armor Penetration and Physical Attack will make her hits even more devastating, especially when paired with her Harlequin's Punishment skill.</p>

    <h3>3. Ring of Agility (Agility)</h3>
    <p>Finally, the Ring of Agility will enhance Peech’s Agility, improving her Physical Attack and Armor. This is a great way to round out her stats and make her a true force to be reckoned with.</p>

      <td>Romantic Skin</td>
      <td>+106,645 Health</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <div>
    <h3>Peech Skins Priority Explanations</h3>
    <p><strong>1st - Mythical Super Skin:</strong> Crushing greatly increases all damage dealt to enemies with low health. This works with all types of damage and synergizes perfectly with Peech’s area attacks and her continuous damage from “The Final Act.” Essential for finishing off enemies effectively.</p>

    <p><strong>2nd - Default Skin (Agility):</strong> Boosts physical attack, and armor. This directly enhances Peech's offensive capabilities and survivability, making it the second most important skin to upgrade.</p>

    <p><strong>3rd - Romantic Skin (Health):</strong> While the health bonus improves survivability, it is less of a priority since Peech usually stays at a distance and controls the battlefield using knockback and debuffs.</p>

    <h2>Synergies: Peech and the Chaos Crew</h2>
    <p>Peech works best with other Chaos heroes, and her abilities synergize particularly well with Krista, Lars, Xe'sha, Kayla, Aidan, Astaroth, and Cleaver. Let’s take a closer look at how these heroes can complement Peech’s skills:</p>

    <h3>Krista</h3>
    <p>Krista’s <strong>Icy Vengeance</strong> and <strong>Chains of Frost</strong> skills are perfect for setting up Peech’s attacks. Chains of Frost reduces the enemy’s Magic Defense, making them more vulnerable to Peech’s physical attacks. Plus, the Mark of Water applied by Krista’s skills can be exploited by other heroes like Lars.</p>

    <h3>Lars</h3>
    <p>Lars’ <strong>Lord of the Storm</strong> and <strong>Lightning Bolt</strong> skills are great for crowd control. His ability to drag enemies to the center of the battlefield and stun them creates the perfect opportunity for Peech to unleash her Theater of Pain and Harlequin's Punishment.</p>

    <h3>Xe'sha</h3>
    <p>Xe'sha’s <strong>Deadly Ray</strong> and <strong>Soaring Might</strong> skills make her a powerful ally for Peech. Deadly Ray drains health from allies to deal massive damage to enemies, while Soaring Might gives Xe'sha a permanent Magic Attack bonus based on the health lost by allies. This can create a deadly combo when paired with Peech’s damage-boosting abilities.</p>

    <h3>Kayla and Aidan</h3>
    <p>Kayla’s <strong>Phoenix's Fury</strong> and Aidan’s <strong>Phoenix Ritual</strong> are a match made in heaven for Peech. Kayla’s ability to deal damage and increase her health pairs well with Peech’s Stage Presence, while Aidan’s sacrifice-based skills can boost the team’s overall survivability.</p>

    <h3>Astaroth and Cleaver</h3>
    <p>Astaroth’s <strong>Flame Veil</strong> provides a shield that blocks physical damage, giving Peech more time to build up her strength. Cleaver’s <strong>Rusty Hook</strong> and <strong>Putrefaction</strong> skills are great for controlling the battlefield and dealing damage to enemies, making him a valuable ally for Peech.</p>
