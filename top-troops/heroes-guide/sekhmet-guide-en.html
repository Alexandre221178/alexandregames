<h2>Who is Sekhmet?</h2>

<p>Before we dive into strategies, let’s take a moment to appreciate Sekhmet’s backstory. Millennia ago, Sekhmet was the protector of an empire, saving her people from invasions and plagues. After her duty was done, she was buried with perfumed oils and riches, promised an eternal vacation. But now, she’s been summoned to King's Bay, and she’s not exactly thrilled about it! Despite her reluctance, Sekhmet is a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield, offering unparalleled support to her allies.</p>

<p>As a <strong>Legendary Support Unit</strong>, Sekhmet excels at healing and shielding her allies, making her an indispensable part of any team. Her abilities are tailored to keep your strongest troops alive and thriving, even in the toughest battles. Let’s break down her skills and how to use them effectively.</p>

<h2>Sekhmet’s Abilities and Skill Priorities</h2>

<h3>1. Healing Wave</h3>

<p><strong>Healing Wave</strong> is Sekhmet’s bread and butter. With every regular attack, she releases a healing wave that restores 26% of her Max Health to allies within a radius of 3. This ability is crucial for sustaining your team during prolonged fights.</p>

<p><strong>Level-Up Effect:</strong><br>
- Heals +10% of Max Health<br>
- Heals +14% of Max Health<br>
- Heals +16% of Max Health<br>
- Heals +20% of Max Health<br>
- Heals +26% of Max Health</p>

<p><strong>Skill Level-Up Priority:</strong> 1st<br>
This skill should be your top priority when leveling up Sekhmet. The increased healing output ensures your team stays alive longer, especially in high-damage scenarios.</p>

<h3>2. Piercing Light</h3>

<p><strong>Piercing Light</strong> enhances the radius of Sekhmet’s Healing Wave, increasing it by 5.5. This allows her to heal more allies simultaneously, making her even more effective in large-scale battles.</p>

<p><strong>Level-Up Effect:</strong><br>
- Area Radius +3.5<br>
- Area Radius +4<br>
- Area Radius +4.5<br>
- Area Radius +5<br>
- Area Radius +5.5</p>

<p><strong>Skill Level-Up Priority:</strong> 2nd<br>
Increasing the radius of Healing Wave ensures that more allies benefit from Sekhmet’s healing, making this skill a close second in terms of priority.</p>

<h3>3. Ra's Blessing</h3>

<p><strong>Ra's Blessing</strong> boosts Sekhmet’s Block Chance by 50%, making her more durable in battles. While this skill is useful, it’s not as critical as her healing and shielding abilities.</p>

<p><strong>Level-Up Effect:</strong><br>
- Block Chance +30%<br>
- Block Chance +35%<br>
- Block Chance +40%<br>
- Block Chance +45%<br>
- Block Chance +50%</p>

<p><strong>Skill Level-Up Priority:</strong> 4th<br>
Since Sekhmet should ideally stay behind her allies, this skill is less of a priority. However, it’s still valuable for ensuring her survival if enemies manage to reach her.</p>

<h3>4. Golden Aegis</h3>

<p><strong>Golden Aegis</strong> is Sekhmet’s ultimate ability. Every 10 seconds, she casts a shield around the ally with the highest attack stat, absorbing damage equal to 65% of her Max Health. If the highest-damage ally already has a shield, Sekhmet will shield the next highest-damage ally.</p>

<p><strong>Level-Up Effect:</strong><br>
- Shield Health +30% of Max Health<br>
- Shield Health +40% of Max Health<br>
- Shield Health +50% of Max Health<br>
- Shield Health +60% of Max Health<br>
- Shield Health +65% of Max Health</p>

<p><strong>Skill Level-Up Priority:</strong> 3rd<br>
This skill is essential for protecting your key damage dealers, but it’s slightly less critical than her healing abilities. Prioritize it after Healing Wave and Piercing Light.</p>

<h2>Gears Priority</h2>

<p>Equipping Sekhmet with the right gears is crucial for maximizing her effectiveness. Here’s a breakdown of the best gear priorities for her:</p>

<div class="emblem">
    <div class="emblem-title">
        <img src="../img-top-troops/pictures-top-troops/gears/health.webp" alt="Health Gear" title="Health Gear - Top Troops" loading="lazy">
        <h3>Health Gear:</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Health is the most important stat for Sekhmet, as her healing and shielding abilities scale with her Max Health. Prioritize gears that boost her Health to ensure she can sustain her team effectively.</p>
</div>

<div class="emblem">
    <div class="emblem-title">
        <img src="../img-top-troops/pictures-top-troops/gears/block-chance.webp" alt="Block Chance Gear" title="Block Chance Gear - Top Troops" loading="lazy">
        <h3>Block Chance Gear:</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Block Chance is another key stat for Sekhmet, as it increases her survivability. While she should stay behind her allies, having a high Block Chance ensures she can withstand any stray attacks that come her way.</p>
</div>

<div class="emblem">
    <div class="emblem-title">
        <img src="../img-top-troops/pictures-top-troops/gears/cooldown.webp" alt="Cooldown Gear" title="Cooldown Gear - Top Troops" loading="lazy">
        <h3>Cooldown Gear:</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Reducing Sekhmet’s cooldowns allows her to cast her abilities more frequently, making her even more effective in battles. Prioritize gears that lower her cooldowns after Health and Block Chance.</p>
</div>

<h2>Talents Priority</h2>

<p>When it comes to talents, Sekhmet benefits most from those that enhance her survivability and support capabilities. Here’s the recommended priority:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Health:</strong> Increasing Sekhmet’s Health directly boosts her healing and shielding abilities, making this the top talent priority.</li>
    <li><strong>Defense:</strong> Defense talents help Sekhmet survive longer, ensuring she can continue to support her team throughout the battle.</li>
    <li><strong>Move Speed:</strong> While not as critical as Health and Defense, Move Speed talents can help Sekhmet reposition herself more effectively during battles.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Best Allies for Sekhmet</h2>

<p>Sekhmet works best when paired with high-damage units that can benefit from her healing and shielding. Here are some of the best allies to pair with her:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>High-Damage Dealers:</strong> Units like <a href="../heroes-guide/el-bandolero-guide-en.html"><strong>El Bandolero</strong></a>   or <a href="../heroes-guide/werewolf-unit-in-top-troops-guide-en.html"><strong>Werewolf</strong></a> are perfect allies for Sekhmet, as they can deal massive damage while being protected by her shields.</li>
    <li><strong>Tanks:</strong> Pairing Sekhmet with a strong tank like <strong>Holy Protector</strong> or <a href="../heroes-guide/spirited-tiger-guide-en.html"><strong>Spirited Tiger</strong></a>
        ensures that your frontline can withstand enemy attacks while Sekhmet supports from the back.</li>
    <li><strong>Other Support Units:</strong> Combining Sekhmet with another support unit like <strong>Archangel</strong> can create an almost unkillable team, as the combined healing and shielding will keep your troops alive through even the toughest battles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Counters to Sekhmet</h2>

<p>While Sekhmet is a powerful support unit, she does have some weaknesses. Here are a few units and strategies that can counter her effectively:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Assassins:</strong> Units like <strong>Samurai</strong> or <strong>Eira</strong> can bypass the frontline and target Sekhmet directly, taking her out before she can provide too much support.</li>
    <li><strong>Crowd Control:</strong> Units with strong crowd control abilities, such as <strong>Toad Druid</strong> or <strong>Elemental Witch</strong>, can disrupt Sekhmet’s positioning and prevent her from effectively supporting her team.</li>
    <li><strong>Anti-Healer:</strong> <strong>Maman Brigitte</strong>, with her <em>Mamaloi's Curse</em> ability, significantly reduces incoming healing, stacking up to 100%. Once the effect reaches its maximum, she moves on to the next target, making her a strong counter to Sekhmet’s healing and shielding.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Battle Tips for Sekhmet</h2>

<p>The goal of Sekhmet is not to deal damage to enemies. She stays in the place where she is summoned and releases healing waves across the battlefield.</p>

<p>Her Golden Aegis ability shields the ally who deals the most damage. This is an incredibly powerful tool to protect your single-population melee units.</p>

<p>Since she cannot protect herself, keep her away from Assassins and find other ways to ensure she lasts longer in battle!</p>

<p>Sekhmet follows the nearest allied unit at the start of the battle. Position her where she can support the group of units you want to protect.</p>


<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Sekhmet is undoubtedly one of the best support units in <strong>Top Troops</strong>, offering unparalleled healing and shielding capabilities. By prioritizing her skills, equipping her with the right gears, and pairing her with strong allies, you can create a nearly unstoppable team. Remember to keep her protected and positioned behind your frontline to maximize her effectiveness.</p>

<p>Whether you’re looking to dominate in PvP or conquer challenging PvE content, Sekhmet is a unit you’ll want on your side. So, summon her, level her up, and watch as she turns the tide of battle in your favor!</p>
