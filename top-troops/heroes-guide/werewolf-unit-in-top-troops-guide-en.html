<h2>Werewolf Skill Upgrade Priority Guide - Top Troops</h2>

<p>This guide explains how each Werewolf skill works in <strong>Top Troops</strong> and helps you decide which skills to upgrade first. If you are new or have trouble understanding how skills work, don’t worry — each ability is explained clearly, along with the reason why it should be upgraded earlier or later.</p>

<h3>1. Bloody Claws (Main Skill)</h3>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong> Every 6 seconds, the Werewolf makes two quick slashes, hitting enemies in a small area (radius 2). Each slash deals 50% of his Attack Damage.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s HIGH priority:</strong> This is the Werewolf’s main attack. It happens automatically and often. Upgrading this makes him deal more damage all the time. This skill is the most important because it helps in every fight, no matter what.</p>

<h3>2. Moonlight Glow</h3>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong> Every time the Werewolf kills an enemy, he heals himself based on his Attack Damage.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s HIGH priority:</strong> Healing helps the Werewolf stay alive. If he survives longer, he can attack more enemies. This skill works very well with Bloody Claws because he’ll heal as he deals damage.</p>

<h3>3. Feral Instinct</h3>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong> This skill increases the Werewolf’s movement speed by 80%. He runs faster on the battlefield.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s MEDIUM priority:</strong> Running faster helps the Werewolf reach enemies sooner. It’s useful, but it doesn’t deal damage or heal. Upgrade this after the damage and healing skills.</p>

<h3>4. Still Hungry</h3>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong> Every time the Werewolf kills an enemy, his Bloody Claws skill becomes stronger. The more he kills, the more damage he deals with his slashes.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s LOW priority:</strong> This skill gives extra damage, but only after he gets a kill. It doesn’t help at the start of a battle and only becomes useful later. It’s a good bonus, but not needed early.</p>

<h3>Skill Upgrade Priority (from High to Low):</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Bloody Claws</strong> – Main damage, always active.</li>
  <li><strong>Moonlight Glow</strong> – Self-healing after kills keeps him alive.</li>
  <li><strong>Feral Instinct</strong> – Moves faster but doesn’t deal damage or heal.</li>
  <li><strong>Still Hungry</strong> – Bonus damage only after getting kills.</li>
</ol>

    <h2>Gear Evolution Priority for the Werewolf: Focus on Main Stats</h2>
    <p>Equipping the right gear can significantly enhance the Werewolf’s performance. Here’s the optimal gear priority based on its max-level abilities:</p>
    <div class="emblem">
      <div class="emblem-title">
        <img src="../img-top-troops/pictures-top-troops/gears/attack.webp" alt="Attack Gear" title="Attack Gear - Top Troops" loading="lazy">
        <h3>1st - Attack Gear:</h3>
      </div>
      <p>Boosts the raw power of Bloody Claws and enhances the healing from Moonlight Glow, since healing scales with attack damage. Essential for both offense and sustain.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="emblem">
      <div class="emblem-title">
        <img src="../img-top-troops/pictures-top-troops/gears/cooldown.webp" alt="Cooldown Gear" title="Cooldown Gear - Top Troops" loading="lazy">
        <h3>2nd - Cooldown Gear:</h3>
      </div>
      <p>Reduces the 6-second cooldown of Bloody Claws, enabling the Werewolf to deal AoE damage more frequently within a 90s match, greatly increasing total damage output.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="emblem">
      <div class="emblem-title">
        <img src="../img-top-troops/pictures-top-troops/gears/life-steal.webp" alt="Life Steal Gear" title="Life Steal Gear - Top Troops" loading="lazy">
        <h3>3rd - Life Steal Gear:</h3>
      </div>
      <p>Works well with Moonlight Glow by ensuring the Werewolf regenerates health not only from kills but also from continuous damage output, increasing survivability.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="emblem">
      <div class="emblem-title">
        <img src="../img-top-troops/pictures-top-troops/gears/attack-speed.webp" alt="Attack Speed Gear" title="Attack Speed Gear - Top Troops" loading="lazy">
        <h3>4th - Attack Speed Gear:</h3>
      </div>
      <p>Improves basic attack frequency, which helps secure more kills to activate Moonlight Glow and generate additional healing from life steal effects.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="emblem">
      <div class="emblem-title">
        <img src="../img-top-troops/pictures-top-troops/gears/health.webp" alt="Health Points Gear" title="Health Points Gear - Top Troops" loading="lazy">
        <h3>5th - Health Points Gear:</h3>
      </div>
      <p>Provides durability for longer fights, giving the Werewolf more time to activate its skills and self-heal through kills and life steal.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="emblem">
      <div class="emblem-title">
        <img src="../img-top-troops/pictures-top-troops/gears/move-speed.webp" alt="Move Speed Gear" title="Move Speed Gear - Top Troops" loading="lazy">
        <h3>6th - Move Speed Gear:</h3>
      </div>
      <p>Allows the Werewolf to quickly close the gap with enemies or reposition during fights, especially useful for targeting squishy or low-health units to trigger healing.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="emblem">
      <div class="emblem-title">
        <img src="../img-top-troops/pictures-top-troops/gears/critical-chance.webp" alt="Critical Chance Gear" title="Critical Chance Gear - Top Troops" loading="lazy">
        <h3>7th - Critical Chance Gear:</h3>
      </div>
      <p>While extra damage from critical hits is helpful, it’s less reliable than consistent damage from attack or cooldown boosts, so it’s lower in priority.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="emblem">
      <div class="emblem-title">
        <img src="../img-top-troops/pictures-top-troops/gears/defense.webp" alt="Defense Gear" title="Defense Gear - Top Troops" loading="lazy">
        <h3>8th - Defense Gear:</h3>
      </div>
      <p>Provides minor survivability, but the Werewolf’s healing mechanics make defense less impactful than raw HP or life steal.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="emblem">
      <div class="emblem-title">
        <img src="../img-top-troops/pictures-top-troops/gears/block-chance.webp" alt="Block Chance Gear" title="Block Chance Gear - Top Troops" loading="lazy">
        <h3>9th - Block Chance Gear:</h3>
      </div>
      <p>Least useful for the Werewolf, who benefits more from healing and offensive pressure than block mechanics.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Talent Priority for the Werewolf</h2>
    <p>The right talents can take the Werewolf’s performance to the next level. Here are the priorities:</p>
    
    <figure class="img-max">
      <img src="../img-top-troops/pictures-top-troops/talents/melee-talent-tree-top-troops.webp" alt="Warewolf Melee Talent Tree" title="Warewolf Melee Talent Tree - Top Troops" loading="lazy">
      <figcaption>Warewolf Melee Talent Tree, Top Troops.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Damage:</strong> Amplifies the power of Bloody Claws and Still Hungry, making the Werewolf a lethal offensive unit.</li>
        <li><strong>Attack Speed:</strong> Speeds up kill times, maximizing the benefits of Still Hungry and Moonlight Glow while also increasing the Werewolf's DPS.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Team Composition and Battle Strategies</h2>
    
    <h3>Best Allies for the Werewolf</h3>
    <p>The Werewolf thrives when paired with supportive and synergistic units:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Frozen Bowman:</strong> Freezes enemies, allowing the Werewolf to unleash Bloody Claws without interruption.</li>
        <li><strong>Sekhmet:</strong> Heals and cast a shield around the Werewolf, ensuring it stays in the fight longer.</li>
        <li><strong>Elemental Witch:</strong> Provides area-of-effect damage and crowd control, complementing the Werewolf’s capabilities.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Counters and Matchups</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Best Matchups:</strong> The Werewolf truly shines against multi-population units,  particularly when these armies lack strong tanks in their frontline. Its area-of-effect damage allows it to quickly dismantle weaker enemies, snowballing its power as the battle progresses.</li>
        <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> The Werewolf struggles against high-defense units or enemies with high crowd-control potential. Use support units to counter these threats.</li>
    </ul>

Its powerful max-level skills, sustainability, and synergy with various team compositions make it an essential choice for any player aiming for victory in Top Troops.
