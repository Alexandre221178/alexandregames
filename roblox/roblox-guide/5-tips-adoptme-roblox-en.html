      <h2>Tip 1: Favorite the Pet You're Working On</h2>
      <p>When you're making a neon pet, it's easy to lose track of the pet you're working on. Trying to find it again can take ages. To avoid this, make sure to favorite the pet you're working on. This way, it will always be easy to find, and you won't waste time searching for it.</p>
      <p>Here's a quick example: Imagine you're working on a cow, and it keeps disappearing. You're scrolling through your pets, and it's not this cow, not that one either. Finally, you find it, but it took way too long. If you had favorited it, you would have found it instantly. So, always favorite your pet!</p>
  </section>

  <section>
      <h2>Tip 2: Age Your Pets in Stages</h2>
      <p>When you're making a neon pet, you need to age your pets to specific milestones. To keep things organized and efficient, grow all of your pets to the same age level before moving on to the next stage. For example, grow all of your pets to Teen, then Post-Teen, and finally Full Grown.</p>
      <p>I made the mistake of having one Full Grown, two Teens, and one Newborn, and it was a mess. I regretted it because it made the process feel longer and more disorganized. So, keep all your pets at the same stage to stay motivated and on track.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
      <h2>Tip 3: Stay Productive While Waiting</h2>
      <p>Let's face it, aging pets can be boring. While you're waiting for tasks to complete, go watch some YouTube videos, scroll through TikTok, do some chores, or even finish your homework. This will help cure your boredom and keep you motivated.</p>
      <p>Instead of just staring at the screen waiting for your pet to age, use that time productively. You'll feel like you're accomplishing something, and the time will fly by faster.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
      <h2>Tip 4: Create a Grinding Room</h2>
      <p>This tip isn't absolutely necessary, but it can make your life a lot easier. Create a grinding room or house where you have everything you need to age your pets quickly. In your grinding room, you'll need a bed, a piano, a bath or shower, and food and water.</p>
      <p>Having everything in one place makes the process faster and more efficient. You won't need to go to other houses to complete tasks, and you'll save a lot of time. Here's an example: I'm at my grinding house, and everything is so much easier. I have everything I need for almost all of my tasks, and I don't need to go to other houses. It's a game-changer!</p>
  </section>

  <section>
      <h2>Tip 5: Use an ALT Account</h2>
      <p>This is a pro tip! If you have an ALT account, you can use it to speed up the process of making neon pets. Here's how it works: Trade the pet you're making neon to your ALT account, and then age it on both accounts at the same time. This will double your progress and make the process twice as fast.</p>
      <p>For example, if you're working on a cow, trade it to your ALT account, and then age it on both accounts. You'll see the progress bar move much faster, and you'll have your neon pet in no time. It's a genius move, and it works like a charm!</p>
