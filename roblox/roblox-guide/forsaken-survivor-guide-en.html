    This guide offers a comprehensive breakdown of every current survivor in the game and gives you detailed tips on how to master each one, maximizing your impact on the team and increasing your chances of survival.
  </p> 


  <h2>007n7 - The Hacked Hero</h2>
  <div class="emblem">
    <img src="../../roblox/img-roblox/forsaken/007n7-forsaken-roblox.webp" alt="007n7 - Forsaken Roblox" title="007n7 - Forsaken Roblox" loading="lazy">
    <br><span><b>007n7</b></span>
  </div>
  <p>Once a notorious hacker, now a survivalist with a reformed heart. His three tech-based skills allow him to manipulate the battlefield and confuse the killer. He excels in deception, often baiting killers into attacking clones or chasing him while he teleports across the map. 007n7 is not about brute force but outsmarting the opponent with unpredictable movement and misdirection. His skill ceiling is high, making him ideal for advanced players who can multitask and keep track of enemy location and cooldowns.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Clone:</strong> Creates a double to confuse the killer.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool GUI:</strong> Teleports to the furthest survivor spawn point.</li>
    <li><strong>Inject:</strong> Alters clone behavior.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Tips:</strong> Use Clone to divert attention or tank hits. Save GUI teleport for escapes or clutch plays. Keep your clones between you and the killer. Mix up your movements so the killer can’t easily guess your real position. Clone is most effective when placed near walls or corners.</p>
  
  <h2>Builderman - The Machine Master</h2>
  <div class="emblem">
    <img src="../../roblox/img-roblox/forsaken/builderman-forsaken-roblox.webp" alt="Builderman - Forsaken Roblox" title="Builderman - Forsaken Roblox" loading="lazy">
    <br><span><b>Builderman</b></span>
</div>
  <p>Based on Roblox’s CEO, Builderman helps the team through mechanical genius. His role is utility-based, offering offensive and defensive tools through his creations. With the right placement, his sentries and dispensers can shift control of the map, creating safe zones and slowing the killer’s advance. Builderman is best suited to players who understand the map layout and can anticipate enemy movement. Although not a frontline fighter, his ability to change the battlefield environment makes him one of the most strategic characters in the game.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sentry Construction:</strong> Slows and damages the killer.</li>
    <li><strong>Dispenser Construction:</strong> Heals nearby survivors.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Tips:</strong> Build sentries in high-traffic areas. Hide while building to avoid interruptions. Pair with Elliot or Guest 1337 for strong defensive play. Try to predict killer rotations and block paths with sentries. Dispensers are best placed near generators or choke points.</p>

  <h2>Chance – The Gambler</h2>
  <div class="emblem">
    <img src="../../roblox/img-roblox/forsaken/chance-forsaken-roblox.webp" alt="Chance - Forsaken Roblox" title="Chance - Forsaken Roblox" loading="lazy">
    <br><span><b>Chance</b></span>
</div>
  <p>Chance is a high-risk, high-reward survivor whose abilities rely heavily on randomness and luck. His unpredictable nature makes him an exciting, yet volatile choice for players who enjoy gambling with fate. His stats and abilities can fluctuate, creating a unique challenge in every game. He thrives in situations where adapting on the fly is crucial, but he’s not for players who prefer consistency and control.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Unpredictable Fate:</strong> Chance’s maximum HP is random, varying between 70 and 130. This keeps him unpredictable in every match.</li>
    <li><strong>Coin Flip:</strong> A gamble for buffs or debuffs. The outcome of this ability is entirely random, affecting either Chance or an enemy.</li>
    <li><strong>Shoot (Flintlock):</strong> A 50/50 chance outcome when shooting with his flintlock. It can either deal damage or miss entirely.</li>
    <li><strong>Reroll:</strong> Chance has the ability to reset his health and abilities, giving him a fresh start. This is great when he's stuck with low HP or poor abilities.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Playstyle & Tips:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ <strong>Adapt on the fly:</strong> No two games with Chance are the same. Stay flexible and be ready to adjust your strategy based on the random outcomes.</li>
    <li>✅ <strong>Reroll if stuck with low HP:</strong> If your health is too low or you’re in a tough situation, use Reroll to give yourself a second chance.</li>
    <li>✅ <strong>Shoot only in high-stakes moments:</strong> Use the flintlock in moments where the potential outcome is worth the gamble. Don't waste it on low-value targets.</li>
    <li>⚠ <strong>High risk, high reward:</strong> Playing Chance is a gamble in itself. You may experience great successes, but be prepared for unexpected outcomes it's not for those who prefer stability.</li>
  </ul>
  


  <h2>Dusekkar - The Mysterious Architect</h2>
  <div class="emblem">
    <img src="../../roblox/img-roblox/forsaken/dusekkar-forsaken-roblox.webp" alt="Dusekkar - Forsaken Roblox" title="Dusekkar - Forsaken Roblox" loading="lazy">
    <br><span><b>Dusekkar</b></span>
</div>
<p>Dusekkar is a unique support survivor with abilities to protect his teammates and manipulate the environment around him. He is a retired Roblox technical director and chief architect, known for his skills in audio manipulation and space control. In Forsaken, he stands out with his spiritual tactics and defensive abilities. He is great for players who enjoy protecting allies and making it harder for the killer to act.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Levitation:</strong> Dusekkar can levitate off the ground to hide his footsteps, making him harder to track.</li>
  <li><strong>Spawn Protection:</strong> He can cast a protective shield on an ally, making them highly resistant to attacks for 8 seconds.</li>
  <li><strong>Plasma Beam:</strong> Dusekkar can shoot a plasma beam that slows both him and the killer when it hits. It also grants a slight speed boost to the ally hit for 4 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong> Use the Levitation ability to move quietly, which is crucial for escaping killer traps. When using Spawn Protection, time it right to shield an ally in danger, allowing them to heal or escape. Combine Plasma Beam with other survivors' abilities to slow down the killer and buy more time for your team to complete objectives.</p>

  
  <h2>Elliot - The Pizza Healer</h2>
  <div class="emblem">
    <img src="../../roblox/img-roblox/forsaken/elliot-forsaken-roblox.webp" alt="Elliot - Forsaken Roblox" title="Elliot - Forsaken Roblox" loading="lazy">
    <br><span><b>Elliot</b></span>
</div>
  <p>Elliot, Builder Brothers’ best employee, is a support survivor dedicated to keeping others alive, even at his own expense. His abilities center around healing and tracking injured allies, making him vital in team-based strategies. He thrives when surrounded by others and can turn the tide of a match with well-placed heals and movement buffs. Elliot is not meant for direct confrontation but excels when coordinated with tanks and mobile characters. His pizza-based abilities not only heal but encourage coordination through pickups and timing, which can dramatically shift a game’s outcome in your favor.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Order Up (Passive):</strong> Heals 5% more.</li>
    <li><strong>Deliver’s Resolve:</strong> Reveals recently injured survivors.</li>
    <li><strong>Pizza Throw:</strong> Heals whoever picks it up.</li>
    <li><strong>Rush Hour:</strong> Grants a large speed burst when fully charged.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Tips:</strong> Stay near groups to maximize healing impact. Always have a pizza ready during chases. Avoid healing yourself unless absolutely necessary. Try to predict where your teammates will run when injured so you can set up healing spots ahead of time. Elliot is strongest when coordinated with players who know how to take hits and fall back to recover.</p>
  

  <h2>Guest 1337 - The Last Warrior</h2>
  
  <div class="emblem">
    <img src="../../roblox/img-roblox/forsaken/guest-137-forsaken-roblox.webp" alt="Guest 1337 - Forsaken Roblox" title="Guest 1337 - Forsaken Roblox" loading="lazy">
    <br><span><b>Guest 1337</b></span>
</div>
  <p>The legendary protagonist from “The Last Guest,” Guest 1337 is the definition of a noble tank. He can absorb punishment, disrupt killer attacks, and open paths for allies. His playstyle is about positioning and timing. You’ll need to anticipate killer abilities and react with blocks or charges. His invincibility makes him ideal for rescuing teammates, but overuse can leave him vulnerable. He works best when paired with a healer like Elliot, letting him stay on the frontline longer without risking elimination.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Made to Last:</strong> Starts with 115 HP.</li>
    <li><strong>Block:</strong> Slows you but grants invincibility. Successful blocks provide speed boost.</li>
    <li><strong>Charge:</strong> Dashes forward, knocking back and disabling the killer.</li>
    <li><strong>Punch:</strong> Stuns or parries attacks.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Tips:</strong> Use Charge as a rescue or interruption tool. Block is best used right before killer abilities trigger. Play frontline to protect healing survivors like Elliot. Be the shield for your team, and they’ll carry you through the match. Knowing when to strike back with Punch can turn a losing battle around.</p>



  <h2>Noob - The Snack-Fueled Survivor</h2>
  
  <div class="emblem">
        <img src="../../roblox/img-roblox/forsaken/noob-forsaken-roblox.webp" alt="Noob - Forsaken Roblox" title="Noob - Forsaken Roblox" loading="lazy">
        <br><span><b>Noob</b></span>
  </div>

<p>The classic yellow-headed Robloxian is cheerful, food-loving, and focused entirely on personal survival. His three simple yet effective abilities are essential for players who like to play solo or support stealthy escapes. Noob isn’t about team play, but rather staying alive and being an unpredictable force for the killer to deal with. With a mixture of temporary boosts, invincibility, and invisibility, Noob's kit is all about outmaneuvering the threat while enjoying his iconic snacks. His unique abilities make him easy to understand but hard to counter in the hands of a clever player.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bloxy Cola:</strong> Slight speed boost.</li>
<li><strong>Slight Skin Potion:</strong> Temporary invincibility.</li>
<li><strong>Ghostberger:</strong> Grants partial invisibility.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong> Use Ghostberger strategically to bypass killers or hide. Save Slight Skin Potion for emergencies. He’s self-sufficient, but pairing with Cappy improves his support potential. Use Bloxy Cola to reposition quickly when cornered. Timing is everything with Noob use your abilities in a combo to confuse and escape the killer when it matters most.</p>

 
 
  
  <h2>Shedletsky - The Sword-Wielding Guardian</h2>
  <div class="emblem">
    <img src="../../roblox/img-roblox/forsaken/shedletsky-forsaken-roblox.webp" alt="Shedletsky - Forsaken Roblox" title="Shedletsky - Forsaken Roblox" loading="lazy">
    <br><span><b>Shedletsky</b></span>
</div>
  <p>A centennial survivor and historical Roblox admin, Shedletsky is a fighter with healing capabilities. His unique blend of offense and sustainability makes him suitable for mid-line engagement, where he can dash in, disrupt, and then retreat to recover. He is particularly effective at saving other survivors due to his ability to stun and self-heal. Shedletsky’s playstyle requires good reflexes and timing. Knowing when to engage with Slash or hold back and use Fried Chicken for survival can mean the difference between escape and capture.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Slash:</strong> Stuns the killer briefly but slows Shedletsky.</li>
    <li><strong>Fried Chicken:</strong> Self-healing ability usable twice.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Tips:</strong> Save Slash for saving others or last-second escapes. Time your healing carefully. If matched against One Times One, expect high tension in the endgame. Pair with characters who distract the killer so you can step in with Slash and retreat safely. He’s a strong counter to aggressive killers who rely on straight chases.</p>
    
  
<h2>Taph - The Silent Demolitionist</h2>
<div class="emblem">
  <img src="../../roblox/img-roblox/forsaken/taph-forsaken-roblox.webp" alt="Taph - Forsaken Roblox" title="Taph - Forsaken Roblox" loading="lazy">
  <br><span><b>Taph</b></span>
</div>
<p>Taph is the newest survivor added to Forsaken. Before joining Forsaken, he was a demolitionist who served admins, including Builderman. He was responsible for destroying the homes of terminated users and reusing their parts for building new houses. After being hunted down by angry protesters, Taph locked himself in his home, setting traps to protect himself. Now in Forsaken, he is a mute demolitionist who uses his trap-setting abilities to help survivors escape.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Trip Wire:</strong> Taph can place a trip wire on the ground that slows down the killer and alerts other survivors about the killer's location.</li>
  <li><strong>Subspace Trip Mine:</strong> Taph can place a mine that becomes invisible after being placed. When the killer gets close, it detonates, disabling their abilities and giving them a dark, pinkish vision for 5 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong> Use the Trip Wire to alert your team about the killer's location and slow them down. Place Subspace Trip Mines in strategic spots, especially near chokepoints or areas where the killer tends to roam. If you're near the Subspace Trip Mine, be cautious, as it will also affect your vision. Since Taph communicates using gestures and emojis, pay close attention to his signals to understand when it's safe to move or when a trap is triggered.</p>

<h2>Two Time - The Reborn Cultist</h2>
<div class="emblem">
<img src="../../roblox/img-roblox/forsaken/two-time-forsaken-roblox.webp" alt="Two Time - Forsaken Roblox" title="Two Time - Forsaken Roblox" loading="lazy">
<br><span><b>Two Time</b></span>
</div>
<p>Two Time is a unique survivalist who represents resurrection. Although under rework, his current mechanic revolves around death and rebirth. He’s one of the few characters who benefits from dying, which creates new tactical possibilities during a match. Playing Two Time requires an understanding of risk and timing, as his second life brings more durability but demands a smarter, more aggressive approach. This dual-phase design rewards players who can manage the fine balance between baiting the killer and surviving long enough to respawn into a more powerful version of themselves.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Second Life:</strong> Upon death, he respawns with 40 health, increasing his max HP to 110.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong> Use his first life to gather intel or distract the killer. After rebirth, play more aggressively with the increased health pool. Avoid 1v1s unless your ability has triggered. Be prepared to reposition quickly after resurrection, as killers often anticipate your return. Use your extra health to tank for allies who are more vulnerable.</p>


  <h2>General Tips for Forsaken Survival</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stay in groups:</strong> Survivors are strongest together. Healers and tanks benefit from tight formations.</li>
    <li><strong>Learn killer patterns:</strong> Each killer has a playstyle. Observe and adapt.</li>
    <li><strong>Communicate:</strong> Ping locations and inform allies about cooldowns and healing opportunities.</li>
    <li><strong>Play your role:</strong> Don’t try to tank as Elliot or support as Noob. Use your survivor’s strengths.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Synergies and Combos</h2>
  <p>Team composition matters. Try these combos to maximize team efficiency and survivability. Strategic pairings can drastically shift the balance of power. Pairing tanky characters with healers ensures sustained frontline defense, while deceptive or mobile survivors can distract or mislead the killer, giving your team crucial time. Try mixing roles to ensure flexibility across different maps and killer matchups.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Elliot + Guest 1337:</strong> Tank and healer combo perfect for attrition gameplay.</li>
    <li><strong>Noob + Two Time:</strong> Great for solo runs and distractions.</li>
    <li><strong>Builderman + Shedletskyi:</strong> Control the battlefield while damaging the killer.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Future Survivors to Watch</h2>
  <p>Azur, the former partner of Two Time, is confirmed to join the roster soon. Expect interesting synergy or conflict if both are in the same match. Cool Kid is also rumored to be a potential killer or companion character. Keep an eye on patch notes and developer updates for balance changes and new additions that can change the survivor meta.</p>
  
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Each survivor in <strong>Roblox Forsaken</strong> is a piece of a much larger story and strategy. From Noob’s food-based stealth to Shleski’s combat prowess, learning the ins and outs of every character gives you a strategic edge. Take time to experiment with different playstyles, adapt to various killers, and communicate with your team. The more survivors you master, the more adaptable and unpredictable you become. Keep this guide handy, master your favorite survivor, and help lead your team to survival!</p>
