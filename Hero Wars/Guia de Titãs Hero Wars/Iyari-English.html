    <h2>Analyzing Titan Iyari in Dungeon</h2>

  <p>When it comes to navigating the challenges of dungeon exploration in 5v5 battles, the inclusion of Titan Iyari emerges as a strategic imperative. This analysis delves into the significance of integrating Iyari into dungeon teams, particularly emphasizing her synergy with Sigurd and her role in bolstering team sustainability.</p>

  <h3>Synergy with Sigurd:</h3>

  <p>One of the standout advantages of employing Iyari in dungeon encounters is her seamless synergy with Sigurd, the tank titan renowned for his resilience on the battlefield. Iyari's ability to swiftly heal the ally with the lowest health, often Sigurd in this context, ensures that crucial frontline protector remains in the fight, bolstering team survivability in the face of adversity. Furthermore, her energy restoration capabilities synergize harmoniously with Sigurd's artifact usage, enabling him to unleash devastating abilities more frequently, thereby amplifying the team's offensive and defensive capabilities.</p>

  <h3>Strategic Healing and Energy Restoration:</h3>

  <p>Beyond her synergy with Sigurd, Iyari's role in dungeon expeditions extends to providing strategic healing and energy restoration to the entire team. By adeptly managing her skills, particularly her ultimate ability, Iyari can effectively restore health to earth, fire, and water tanks, ensuring their longevity in the heat of battle. This tactical healing not only sustains frontline units but also contributes to the overall stability of the team composition, enabling sustained progress through dungeon challenges.</p>

  <h3>Maximizing Investment in Iyari:</h3>

  <p>Investing in Iyari for dungeon endeavors proves to be a prudent decision, yielding substantial returns in terms of team resilience and effectiveness. Her innate ability to mitigate damage and restore energy translates to enhanced survivability and prolonged engagements, ultimately increasing the likelihood of success in conquering dungeon obstacles. By strategically incorporating Iyari into 5v5 dungeon teams, players can capitalize on her healing prowess to overcome the formidable challenges that lie ahead.</p>

                  <h3>Artifacts Priority</h3>
                 


<p>When investing in Iyari's artifacts, it's essential to prioritize the Seal of Balance to maximize her potential on the battlefield. This artifact not only enhances her overall survivability but also boosts her physical attack, which is crucial for amplifying the effectiveness of her healing skills. By increasing her physical attack, Iyari can heal more efficiently, ensuring that her team remains sustained during intense battles.</p>

<p>Additionally, it's advisable to level up the Crown of Light to augment Iyari's offensive and defensive capabilities further. This artifact provides additional damage output while also offering enhanced defense against fire, earth, and water titans. Strengthening the Crown of Light not only amplifies Iyari's contribution to the team's damage output but also fortifies her resilience against elemental threats, thereby increasing her overall versatility on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Lastly, prioritizing the advancement of the Face of Belav weapon proves to be a strategic decision to bolster the team's defense during critical moments. When Iyari unleashes her ultimate ability, the Face of Belav provides valuable extra defense to the entire team, mitigating incoming damage and enhancing their survivability. This additional layer of protection can be instrumental in turning the tide of battles and ensuring the team's endurance in prolonged engagements.</p>

                       <p>While Iyari initially possesses only the default physical attack skin, prioritizing its enhancement is highly beneficial. Increasing her physical attack directly correlates with the potency of her healing abilities, resulting in a greater restoration of health points to her allies during battles.</p>
