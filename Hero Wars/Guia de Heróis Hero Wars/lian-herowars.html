    <h2>Get to Know Lian's Abilities</h2>
    <p>
        Before diving into the strategies, it's crucial to understand Lian's abilities:
    </p>

    
<!-- adx- joinads with lazy -->

<!-- adx- joinads with lazy -->



    <ul>
        <li><strong>Enchantment:</strong> This ability enchants all enemies, putting them to sleep for 7 seconds. Enemies wake up when taking damage, but Lian's attack doesn't wake them up.</li>
        <li><strong>Hypnotic Dance:</strong> Lian fires a magic ball at the nearest enemies, dealing pure damage wherever it passes. This ability can cause a total of 54,226.5 damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Inconstant Lights:</strong> She creates 5 magic spheres and launches them at the nearest enemy, causing magical damage. Each sphere can cause up to 32,535.9 damage.</li>
        
        
        
        
        <li><strong>Reconciliation:</strong> This is a passive ability. When Lian takes damage, the enemy who dealt the damage is enchanted for 4 seconds.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

    <h2>Usage Strategies</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Crowd Control</h3>
            <p>
                Lian shines when it comes to crowd control. Use her Enchantment ability to put all enemies to sleep for 7 seconds. This can be crucial to interrupt devastating combos from enemy heroes, especially those relying on area attacks.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Devastating Combos</h3>
            <p>
                Combine Lian's abilities with those of her allies to create devastating combos. For example, synchronize Lian's Enchantment with other heroes' area damage abilities to maximize crowd control and damage potential.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Efficient Counter-Attack</h3>
            <p>
                Take advantage of Lian's Reconciliation passive ability to perform efficient counter-attacks. When she takes damage, the enemy who dealt it will be enchanted for 4 seconds. Use this time to launch powerful attacks and tilt the battlefield in your favor.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Focus on Primary Targets</h3>
            <p>
                Prioritize your attacks on the most important targets. Use Inconstant Lights to cause concentrated damage to the nearest enemy. This can be particularly useful for eliminating long-range threats or enemy healers supporting their team.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Adaptation to the Situation</h3>
            <p>
                Be prepared to adapt your strategies based on the enemy team composition and battle conditions. Lian is versatile and can play different roles depending on the situation. Be flexible and willing to adjust your tactics as needed.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Analysis of Lian's Talisman of Charm</h2>
   
      <p>
        Lian is a very strong heroine with an incredible Ultimate, and now with her Talisman of Charm, she has become even stronger. She is not a hero focused on causing a lot of damage, but rather on using her skills to enchant enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Leveling up Lian's Talisman of Charm is not a priority for beginners, but she certainly gets very strong with this talisman.

<h2>Analysis of Lian's Talisman of Cuteness</h2>

    <p>Lian’s second talisman, the Cuteness Talisman, is crucial for enhancing her support role in <em>Hero Wars Alliance</em>. By providing her with additional armor and health, this talisman significantly boosts her survivability, allowing her to stay on the battlefield longer and fulfill her main function: paralyzing enemies with her enchanting abilities. With this boost, Lian becomes more resilient against attacks and more effective as a support hero.</p>

    <p>Since Lian’s primary role isn’t dealing damage but rather keeping enemies under control, the Charm Talisman suits her perfectly by making her more tanky. The extra health absorbs both physical and magical damage, and the armor reduces physical attacks, which means that in her backline position, she can endure longer and cast her abilities more frequently. This durability gives her allies more opportunities to defeat opponents while Lian keeps enemies occupied.</p>

    <p>The Cuteness Talisman makes it harder for enemies to eliminate Lian quickly, allowing her to repeatedly enchant and put enemies to sleep, which disrupts their attacks and strategies. This second talisman is ideal for Lian’s role, enhancing her effectiveness by keeping her alive and active, ensuring she can continuously hinder the enemy team.</p>

        <h3>Lian Skins Priority</h3>
        <p>Lian’s priority lies in enhancing survivability and team utility. Health and Armor are essential to keep her in battle longer, supporting allies effectively. Intelligence improves her abilities’ versatility, while Magic Defense ensures resilience against magic-heavy enemies. These stats allow Lian to perform her role as a durable support hero, focusing on protecting her team.</p> 
        <p>The Crushing Skin synergizes well with Lian's pure damage, effectively targeting the enemy with the lowest health. This focused redirection enhances her ability to finish off weaker opponents, making her a stronger support option when paired with heroes like Dorian, who amplify healing based on damage dealt.</p>
