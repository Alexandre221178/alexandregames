        <h2>Strategy on how to use Arachne in Hero Wars Alliance</h2>
     
            <p>Arachne is one of the heroes of the progress faction and has the ability to cause stun in the area. She is very strong against teams of Keira and Karkh, and other agility heroes. Now, with the arrival of Fafnir in Hero Wars, Arachne becomes a great ally against Fafnir teams with her abilities to stun for 5 seconds and also to poison enemies in any type of damage she causes, it is certainly a good choice. I am always surprised with strong Arachne in special events, but she is not often seen on end-game teams, maybe it will become important with the arrival of Fafnir.</p>
    </section>
    


        <section>
            <h3>Understanding Arachne's Abilities</h3>
            <p>Before diving into the strategy of using Arachne, it is essential to understand her abilities and how they can be effectively used in battle:</p>
    
            <section>
                <h3>Area Stun</h3>
                <p>Arachne's ability to cause area stun is one of her main advantages. This stun can interrupt enemy abilities and unbalance the opposing team.</p>
            </section>
    
            <section>
                <h3>Poisoning</h3>
                <p>In addition to stunning, Arachne also has the ability to poison her enemies. This adds significant damage over time (DOT), gradually weakening opponents.</p>
            </section>
    
            <section>
                <h3>Synergy with Other Heroes</h3>
                <p>Arachne can benefit from synergies with other heroes. Understanding which heroes complement her abilities can increase her effectiveness in battle.</p>
            </section>
        </section>
    
        <section>
            <h3>Strategies for Using Arachne in Hero Wars Alliance</h3>
            
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Identifying Priority Targets</h3>
                    <p>When using Arachne, it is crucial to identify priority targets for her abilities. Look to stun enemies that pose the greatest threat to your team, such as healers or high damage heroes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Coordination with Other Stunners</h3>
                    <p>Arachne can work together with other heroes who have stun abilities. By synchronizing these abilities, you can keep enemies stunned for longer periods, granting a tactical advantage to your team.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Exploiting Enemy Weaknesses</h3>
                    <p>Arachne is particularly effective against teams composed of agility heroes, such as Keira and Karkh. When facing these opponents, focus on maximizing the use of her stun and poisoning abilities to weaken them quickly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Strategies against Fafnir Teams</h3>
                    <p>With the arrival of Fafnir, Arachne becomes a valuable strategic choice. Her stun and poisoning abilities can be crucial in dealing with teams that contain Fafnir. Prioritize using her abilities to neutralize Fafnir's attacks and chip away at the health of his allies.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Building a Cohesive Team</h3>
                    <p>When including Arachne in your team, ensure to build a cohesive composition that maximizes her abilities. Consider heroes that can amplify her stun and poisoning, as well as provide additional support to the team.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Upgrading Artifacts and Equipment</h3>
                    <p>Don't forget to regularly upgrade Arachne's artifacts and equipment. This will increase her statistics and make her even more formidable in battle.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Adjusting Positioning within the Team</h3>
                    <p>Arachne's positioning within the team can make all the difference in a battle. Place her strategically to maximize the reach of her stun and poisoning abilities, prioritizing her protection against enemy assaults.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Learning the Right Time to Act</h3>
                    <p>Knowing the right time to use Arachne's abilities is crucial. Avoid wasting her stun abilities at inappropriate times and wait for the right moment to unbalance the opposing team and secure a decisive advantage.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Understanding Arachne's Weaknesses</h3>
                    <p>Despite her powerful abilities, Arachne also has her weaknesses. Be aware of the strategies and abilities of opponents that can neutralize or mitigate her impact in battle. Properly protect Arachne and be prepared to adjust your strategy as necessary.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Constant Evolution</h3>
                    <p>As in any game, constant evolution is essential to remain competitive. Continue to refine Arachne's abilities, experiment with new strategies, and adapt to changes in the game's meta. Be open to learning from other teams and players to further enhance your skills with Arachne.</p>

            <h3>1-Increased Magical Defense</h3>

This increased resilience ensures that Arachne can endure prolonged engagements and remain a formidable presence on the battlefield.</p>
       
    
       
            <h3>2-Enhanced Magical Attacks</h3>

            <section>
                <h3>Arachne's Stat Evolution</h3>
                <p>
                    Arachne, as a versatile heroine of Hero Wars Alliance, requires careful strategy to maximize her combat potential. Below are Arachne's evolution priorities, from stats to artifacts and skins.
                </p>
        
                <table>

                <p>
                    <strong>Magic Penetration:</strong> Increasing magic penetration allows Arachne to ignore part of the enemies' magic resistance, thus increasing the damage caused by her magic attacks.<br>
                    <strong>Magic Attack:</strong> The increase in magic attack amplifies the power of her spells, making her attacks more lethal.<br>
                    <strong>Intelligence:</strong> Intelligence not only increases Arachne's magic attack but also her magic defense, making her more resistant to enemy magic attacks.<br>
                    <strong>Health and Armor:</strong> Although less prioritized than offensive statistics, increasing Arachne's health and armor will make her more durable in combat, allowing her to remain active for longer.

                    In artifacts, you should prioritize the book, as it increases life and magic attack, then intelligence to gain more magic attack and magic defense, and finally the weapon to give armor to the whole team.
