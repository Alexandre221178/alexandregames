        <h2>Tempus: Master of Time in Hero Wars Alliance</h2>

<p>In the ever-expanding universe of <strong>Hero Wars Alliance</strong>, a new Guardian has emerged—<strong>Tempus</strong>, a master of time manipulation. Born from the boredom of eternal life, Tempus has chosen to join the ranks of the <strong>Way of Eternity</strong> faction, bringing his unique time-altering abilities to aid his fellow Guardians in combat. As a <strong>Support Hero</strong> who operates from the <strong>Middle Line</strong>, Tempus specializes in controlling the flow of battle, weakening enemies, and enhancing the power of his team, particularly magic users.</p>



<p>In this guide, we will dive into Tempus' abilities, artifacts, and synergies, providing tips on how to maximize his potential in battle.</p>


<h2>Tempus Artifacts Priorities</h2>
<p>Tempus wields a powerful set of artifacts that focus on enhancing his magical prowess and survivability:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>3rd Chronowheel</strong>: Increases Magic Attack.</li>
  <li><strong>1st - Tome of Arcane Knowledge</strong>: Boosts Magic Attack and Health, ensuring Tempus stays alive longer in battle to support his team.</li>
  <li><strong>2nd - Ring of Intelligence</strong>: Amplifies his Intelligence, further strengthening his magic-based skills.</li>
</ul>
<p>These artifacts work in tandem to make Tempus a potent force in magical skirmishes, helping his team resist physical damage while maximizing their magical output.</p>

<h2>Tempus Skin Evolution Priorities in Hero Wars Alliance</h2>

<h3>1. Default Skin (Intelligence) – First Priority</h3>
<p>The Default Skin, which boosts Intelligence, is the top priority for Tempus. This skin significantly enhances both his <strong>magic attack</strong> and <strong>magic defense</strong>, making him a stronger support hero. Increasing Tempus's magic attack boosts the effectiveness of his abilities, while the improved magic defense provides greater survivability, especially against magic-based enemies. This balance between offense and defense makes the Default Skin crucial for Tempus's overall performance in battles.</p>

<h3>2. Stellar Skin (Magic Attack) – Second Priority</h3>
<p>The Stellar Skin, which increases <strong>magic attack</strong>, should be the second priority for Tempus. This skin focuses on maximizing Tempus's damage output, allowing his abilities to hit harder and become more impactful in combat. With this skin, Tempus can play a more offensive role, dealing higher damage and contributing more to the team's overall firepower.</p>


<h2>Synergies</h2>
<p>Tempus works exceptionally well with <strong>Way of Eternity</strong> heroes, but he is particularly potent when paired with:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Iris</strong>: Iris’ debuff abilities complement Tempus’ time manipulation. When Tempus uses his skill <strong>Chronostasis</strong>, it enhances the effects of Iris' debuffs by extending their duration.</li>
  <li><strong>Phobos</strong>: Phobos’ <strong>Curse</strong> ability, which lowers enemy effectiveness, becomes even more deadly when combined with Tempus' skills that slow and weaken enemies.</li>
  <li><strong>Xe'Sha and Celeste</strong>: These powerful mages benefit from Tempus' time manipulation abilities, allowing them to unleash devastating magic while enemies are slowed and unable to defend.</li>
  <li><strong>Morrigan</strong> – Supports Tempus with healing and damage buffs, helping keep him alive in the front lines.</li>
  <li><strong>Nebula</strong> – Enhances Tempus’s magic attack with her boosts, making him more lethal.</li>
  <li><strong>Dante</strong> – Protects Tempus from high burst damage while helping control enemy movement.</li>

</ul>

<section>
  <h2>Detailed Analysis of Tempus’s Talisman of Everlastingness</h2>

<p>Tempus’s <strong>Talisman of Everlastingness</strong> is a vital upgrade for this support hero in the Eternity faction. It enhances <strong>Intelligence</strong>, boosting his <strong>magic attack</strong> and also increasing <strong>armor</strong> and <strong>magic defense</strong>. This makes Tempus a more durable frontline hero, standing in front of Morrigan and behind Dante, protecting the team from enemy attacks.</p>

<p>His talisman provides key defensive stats, turning him into a reliable shield. It enhances his ability to withstand damage while still offering strong support to the rest of his team in both offensive and defensive situations.</p>

  <figcaption>Tempus with The Talisman of Everlastingness, Hero Wars Mobile.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Magic Attack & Intelligence Benefits</h3>

<p>The <strong>Intelligence</strong> boost is crucial because all of Tempus’s abilities scale with magic attack. This means the more Intelligence he gains, the stronger his skills become. His ultimate ability extends debuffs inflicted by allies like <strong>Dante</strong> and <strong>Iris</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, with each point of Intelligence, Tempus' magic attack improves, allowing him to reduce the enemies' magical and physical defenses and extend debuffs by up to 2.5 seconds. This seemingly small advantage has a significant impact over the course of a battle.</p>
<h3>Armor & Magic Defense</h3>

<p>Tempus’s positioning in battles often places him at the front, where he absorbs both physical and magical attacks. The Talisman increases his armor by up to 6,600 per slot, offering <strong>19,800 points</strong> of armor when fully upgraded, significantly improving his defense.</p>

<p>This armor boost turns Tempus into a near-tank, enabling him to sustain longer in combat and protect his teammates, especially when paired with heroes like <strong>Dante</strong> and <strong>Iris</strong>, who rely on his survivability.</p>

<h3>Synergy with Eternity Heroes</h3>

<p>Tempus works exceptionally well with Eternity heroes such as <strong>Dante</strong>, <strong>Iris</strong>, and <strong>Faceless</strong>. His ability to extend their debuffs enhances the overall effectiveness of the team. This synergy is crucial when fighting difficult opponents.</p>

<p>For example, when paired with <strong>Dante</strong>, Tempus can extend Dante's debuffs, allowing more control over the battlefield. His talisman's boost in magic attack enhances his debuff reduction abilities, further assisting in battlefield control.</p>

<h3>Strategic Value in Battle</h3>

<p>The <strong>Talisman of Everlastingness</strong> turns Tempus into more than just a support hero. It transforms him into a key player on the frontline. If your team revolves around <strong>Dante</strong> and <strong>Iris</strong>, this talisman significantly boosts Tempus’s utility.</p>

<p>His enhanced magic attack and defensive stats help him stay alive, prolong debuffs, and assist in crowd control. This makes him valuable in both PvP and PvE battles, especially when facing tougher enemies in high-level content.</p>

<h3>Should You Invest in Tempus’s Talisman?</h3>

<p>Yes, especially if you're building a team focused on Eternity heroes. The talisman is essential for Tempus’s survivability and effectiveness. While acquiring it requires significant resources around 15,000 emeralds it’s worth the investment.</p>

<p>Players who prioritize free-to-play strategies can earn emeralds through missions, making the talisman accessible. Once acquired, Tempus becomes a more formidable asset in any battle, increasing your team’s chances of success in all scenarios.</p>

<p>Without the talisman, Tempus may struggle on the frontline, reducing his ability to support the team. Acquiring it early can make a significant difference in your overall strategy and battle outcomes.</p>

<h2>Skills Breakdown</h2>
<p>Tempus possesses a set of time-bending abilities that can disrupt enemy strategies while empowering his team. Here’s a breakdown of his core skills and how to use them effectively:</p>

<h3>1. Chronostasis</h3>
<p><strong>Skill Description</strong>: Tempus stops time for all enemy Heroes, freezing their movement, skill usage, and evasion. During this time, enemy Armor and Magic Defense are reduced, and the cooldown of all their skills is halted. This ability also prolongs the duration of all Curses and Debuffs affecting the enemies.</p>

<p><strong>Strategy</strong>: <strong>Chronostasis</strong> is a game-changing ability that can turn the tide of battle. By freezing enemy actions and defenses, Tempus creates a window of opportunity for his team’s mages to unleash their most powerful attacks without fear of retaliation. Use this skill at key moments, particularly when enemies are about to use high-impact abilities, to completely nullify their threat. Paired with heroes like Iris and Phobos, it allows you to exploit weakened enemies and maximize damage.</p>

<h3>2. Withering</h3>
<p><strong>Skill Description</strong>: Tempus temporarily weakens distant enemies in front of him, reducing their Physical Attack and max Health.</p>

<p><strong>Strategy</strong>: <strong>Withering</strong> is particularly effective against physical attackers and frontline enemies. This skill allows Tempus to mitigate the damage from opponents who rely on Physical Attack, while also reducing their maximum Health. Use this to soften up enemy tanks or damage dealers, giving your team a clear advantage. This is especially effective when Tempus is positioned against teams with strong physical damage output.</p>

<h3>3. Temporal Anomaly</h3>
<p><strong>Skill Description</strong>: Tempus sends the enemy Hero with the highest Armor Penetration into the <strong>Temporal Anomaly</strong>, where they are slowed down, lose energy, and take continuous magic damage over time.</p>

<p><strong>Strategy</strong>: <strong>Temporal Anomaly</strong> targets the enemy with the highest Armor Penetration, making it an ideal counter against opponents designed to shred through your team's defenses. By isolating and weakening this target, Tempus ensures that your team’s tanks and frontline heroes stay protected longer. Additionally, the magic damage over time can help wear down high-priority enemies.</p>

<h3>4. Time Paradox</h3>
<p><strong>Skill Description</strong>: Tempus summons a giant clock in the center of the battlefield, creating an area of effect (AoE) that slows down enemies while speeding up allies within its range.</p>

<p><strong>Strategy</strong>: <strong>Time Paradox</strong> is Tempus’ ultimate control ability. The AoE affects both enemies and allies, slowing enemies down while boosting the speed of Tempus' team. This can be used to control the pace of battle, allowing your allies to quickly outmaneuver and overpower opponents. In close matches, the ability to manipulate time for both teams can be the difference between victory and defeat. Utilize <strong>Time Paradox</strong> to keep enemies from reaching key objectives or to ensure your team executes attacks with deadly precision.</p>

<h2>Tips for Playing Tempus</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Timing is Everything</strong>: Tempus excels at controlling the battlefield, so using his skills at the right moments is crucial. Don’t rush to use <strong>Chronostasis</strong>; wait until enemies are about to launch their attacks or when key debuffs are in place to maximize its effectiveness.</li>
  <li><strong>Protect Your Mages</strong>: Tempus is most effective when paired with magic-based heroes. Use his time manipulation abilities to shield vulnerable mages from physical attacks and buy them time to unleash their most powerful spells.</li>
  <li><strong>Target Key Opponents</strong>: Use <strong>Temporal Anomaly</strong> to neutralize high-priority targets like enemy heroes with strong Armor Penetration. By removing these threats from the battlefield temporarily, you give your team a significant advantage.</li>
  <li><strong>Maximize AoE Effects</strong>: <strong>Time Paradox</strong> affects both your team and the enemy, so positioning is key. Make sure your team is within the clock’s range to benefit from the speed boost while trapping enemies in its slowing effect.</li>
  <li><strong>Synergize with Debuff Heroes</strong>: Tempus shines when paired with heroes that apply debuffs and curses. Heroes like Iris and Phobos will see their debuffs extended and amplified by <strong>Chronostasis</strong>, allowing you to keep enemies weakened for longer.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><strong>Tempus</strong> is a versatile and powerful support hero whose ability to manipulate time can completely shift the dynamics of a battle. His unique skill set makes him invaluable in teams centered around magic users and debuff strategies. By slowing down enemies, weakening their defenses, and enhancing the power of his allies, Tempus provides strategic depth and a tactical advantage. For players looking to master the art of battlefield control, Tempus is a must-have hero in <strong>Hero Wars Alliance</strong>.</p>
