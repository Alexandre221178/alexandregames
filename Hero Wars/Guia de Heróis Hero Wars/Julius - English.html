                <h2>Julius's Abilities: Strength and Protection</h2>
                
                <h3>Meowsterpiece of Defense:</h3>
                <p>This ability casts a shield in front of Julius's team, absorbing all damage. When the shield is destroyed, all heroes on the team are healed. This ability is especially useful for facing powerful attacks from opponents and keeping your team healthy.</p>
            



                <h3>Mimicry Device:</h3>
                <p>This passive ability increases Julius's physical attack whenever he gains a shield. Additionally, he can cast a shield on himself, which if not destroyed within 5 seconds, is copied to each ally. This ensures additional protection for the entire team, making Julius even more formidable in prolonged combat.</p>
            
                <h3>Nine Lives Engine:</h3>
                <p>Whenever a shield is destroyed on Julius or an ally, they gain bonus armor and magic defense, while all debuffs are removed. This ability is crucial for keeping the team resilient against enemy attacks and ensuring their survival during the most intense battles.</p>
            




                <h3>Perfect Reflexes:</h3>
                <p>This ability passively increases the speed of attacks and abilities for all allies protected by a shield. The bonus is even greater for Progress heroes, significantly enhancing Julius's team effectiveness in combat.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h2>Playing Strategies with Julius:</h2>
                
                <h3>Total Protection:</h3>
                <p>Julius's main function is to protect his team, so position him at the frontline to absorb as much damage as possible with his shield. This allows your damage-dealing allies, like Astrid, Ginger, Keira and Artemis, to attack safely from behind.</p>
            
                <h3>Skill Synergy:</h3>
                <p>Julius has a special synergy with heroes who possess shield abilities. Heroes like Astaroth, Jorgen, and Rufus perfectly complement Julius's defensive abilities, creating an almost impenetrable line of defense.</p>
            
                <h3>Timing Strategies:</h3>
                <p>Julius's ability to cast shields on his allies can be crucial in critical moments of battle. Use it strategically to protect your team against powerful enemy attacks or to reinforce your defense during a deadlock.</p>
            
                <h3>Powerful Attacks in Combination:</h3>
                <p>The ability to increase physical attack whenever Julius gains a shield makes him even more effective when combined with other heroes who deal great damage. Use him in conjunction with Astrid, Ginger, Keira or Daredevil to maximize the team's attack potential.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h2>Skill Synergy: Maximizing Protection</h2>
                <p>Julius is a master of protection, capable of shielding the entire team from any type of damage with his shield. Furthermore, he shines when paired with heroes who possess shield abilities. Check out the list below of heroes who have better synergy with Julius, organized alphabetically:</p>
