                <h3>Understanding Jhu's Strengths and Abilities</h3>
                
                <p>Jhu possesses unique skills that make him a formidable force on the battlefield, especially against hydras. Let's explore his abilities:</p>
                
                <h4>1. You Will Not Stop Me</h4>
                <p>Jhu becomes enraged, significantly increasing his attack speed for 7 seconds. During this time, he cannot die. This ability provides a substantial speed bonus, crucial for dealing damage quickly to enemies.</p>
                
                <h4>2. I Will Take Your Life</h4>
                <p>Each of Jhu's attacks deals additional pure damage to the target while sacrificing 2% of his current health. This ability inflicts percentage-based damage, making it effective against high-health enemies like hydras.</p>
                
                <h4>3. I See You</h4>
                <p>Jhu increases his attack power and focuses his attacks on a ranged enemy for a period of time. This ability provides extra damage and duration, allowing Jhu to efficiently target key opponents.</p>
                
                <h4>4. The Spirits Will Heal Me</h4>
                <p>If Jhu is not under control effects after using the first skill, he regenerates some health. This ability ensures Jhu's sustainability in prolonged battles, increasing his survivability.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h3>Strategies for Using Jhu</h3>
                
                <p>Now that we understand Jhu's capabilities, let's discuss strategies to optimize his performance:</p>
                
                <h4>1. Hydra Combos</h4>
                <p>Pair Jhu with heroes like Mojo, Martha, Thea, Fafnir, Nebula, Celeste, Markus, Cornelius, Faceless, Orion, Rufus, Andvari, and Astaroth to increase your damage output against hydras. Mojo and Martha can boost Jhu's speed, while Thea can provide a speed boost even after being defeated. Fafnir increases damage and defense, further empowering Jhu to take down hydras efficiently.</p>
                
                <h4>2. Targeted Attacks</h4>
                <p>Utilize Jhu's "I See You" skill to focus his attacks on priority targets, especially ranged enemies. This ensures that Jhu efficiently eliminates high-threat opponents, contributing to your team's victory.</p>
                
                <h4>3. Sustainability</h4>
                <p>Leverage Jhu's "The Spirits Will Heal Me" ability to maintain his health during battles. This skill allows Jhu to regenerate health, ensuring his longevity on the battlefield and maximizing his damage potential over time.</p>

                <h3>Additional Tips for Using Jhu Effectively</h3>
                
                <p>To further enhance your gameplay with Jhu, consider the following tips:</p>
                
                <p>1. **Positioning:** Place Jhu strategically in your team formation, ensuring that he is adequately protected while still being able to target high-priority enemies.</p>
                
                <p>2. **Team Synergy:** Experiment with different team compositions to find synergies that complement Jhu's abilities. Heroes with crowd control abilities, such as stuns or silences, can help protect Jhu and enable him to deal more damage uninterrupted.</p>
                
                <p>3. **Continuous Improvement:** Continuously invest in Jhu's skills and level him up to unlock new abilities and increase his stats.</p>
                
                <p>4. **Adaptation:** Be flexible in your approach and adapt your strategies based on the specific challenges you face in battles.</p>
                
                <p>5. **Practice and Experience:** Mastery of Jhu requires practice and experience. Take the time to familiarize yourself with his abilities, understand his matchups against different opponents, and refine your tactics through trial and error.</p>

    <p><strong>Impact on Jhu's Performance:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Increased Survivability:</strong> The additional 80,000 health points significantly enhance Jhu's durability, allowing him to stay longer in battles, especially against tough opponents like the Hydra.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Critical Hits:</strong> With a total of +6600 crit chance, Jhu's attacks are more likely to land critical hits, effectively doubling his physical damage output during critical strikes.</li>
        <li><strong>Balanced Offense and Defense:</strong> The Talisman of Fury provides a well-rounded boost to Jhu, making him more versatile across different types of battles, though he excels particularly in Hydra fights due to his enhanced survivability and damage output.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Optimal Use:</strong><br>
    The Talisman of Fury is best suited for players looking to maximize Jhu's overall effectiveness, particularly in scenarios where both survivability and high damage output are crucial. This talisman is the preferred choice for most battles and Hydra encounters.</p>

    <h3>Talisman of Immortality</h3>

    <p><strong>Overview:</strong><br>
    The Talisman of Immortality focuses on increasing Jhu's physical attack and armor, making it more specialized for countering physical damage teams. The talisman offers:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>+8000 Physical Attack</strong></li>
        <li><strong>+6600 Armor</strong> (across three slots)</li>
    </ul>

    <figure class="img-max">
        <img src="../../img-HWM/Jhu-img/jhu-talisman-of-immortality.webp" alt="Jhu with Talisman of Immortality, Hero Wars Alliance." title="Jhu with Talisman of Immortality, Hero Wars Alliance." loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>Jhu with Talisman of Immortality in level 10, Hero Wars.</figcaption>
      </figure>

    <p><strong>Impact on Jhu's Performance:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Higher Physical Damage:</strong> The +8000 physical attack significantly boosts Jhu's base damage, making him even more lethal in direct confrontations, especially against enemies with lower armor.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Defense Against Physical Attacks:</strong> The +19800 added armor enhances Jhu's ability to withstand physical damage, making him a more durable option against physically oriented teams.</li>
        <li><strong>Specialization Against Physical Damage:</strong> This talisman is particularly effective in battles where Jhu faces teams with strong physical damage output, as it increases his survivability and allows him to counter such threats effectively.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Optimal Use:</strong><br>
    The Talisman of Immortality is ideal for situations where Jhu needs to face off against physical damage dealers. It provides a focused boost to his physical attack and defense, making it a strong choice in specific matchups or when facing physically based Hydras.</p>

    <h3>Which Talisman is Better?</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Talisman of Fury:</strong> This talisman is generally the better choice for most scenarios due to its balanced enhancement of both Jhu's offense and defense. The significant health boost, combined with a high critical hit chance, makes Jhu a well-rounded hero capable of excelling in various situations, especially in Hydra battles.</li>
        <li><strong>Talisman of Immortality:</strong> While this talisman offers strong advantages against physical damage teams, it is more situational. It is best used when Jhu is expected to face heavy physical damage, where the additional armor and physical attack can make a decisive difference.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For most players and situations, the <strong>Talisman of Fury</strong> is the superior choice due to its versatility and comprehensive stat boosts. However, the <strong>Talisman of Immortality</strong> can be highly effective in niche scenarios where Jhu faces significant physical damage. Players should consider their typical opponents and team composition when deciding which talisman to prioritize for Jhu.</p>

        <p>Jhu is a great hero against hydras, Jhu's 1st skill makes him immortal for seven seconds while his 4th skill restores his health; especially if it is used with the hero Mojo that causes damage in his 4th skill even after being dead, that's right, the hydras are not immune to Mojo's mark and you only need to have a Mojo level Purple in combination for this perfect combo to cause a lot of damage in all hydras.
