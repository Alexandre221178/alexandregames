        <h2>Strategy on how to use Aidan</h2>
        <p>Aidan and his sister Kaila are the new heroes of the Chaos faction of 2023,
            arrived with a great synergy with power comparable to the combo of twins Krista and Lars,
            Aidan has the power to resurrect Kayla every time he uses his special ability, and Kayla also can resurrect Aidan whenever she uses her ultimate,
             that way the two become unstoppable.

        </p>
  
      

        <p>In addition, his skills have a lot of sacrifice keywords,
            which means that all the time he sacrifices his life for his team and that makes Xe'sha very strong,
            as her fourth skill Highborne Strength causes her to gain a 25% magic attack bonus whenever
            that an ally sacrifices life using skills and Aidan with skills makes the whole team sacrifice life,
             and in this way, this combo is a success in the Hydras of Hero Wars Mobile.

        </p>
        <p>
            Aidan can also be a good healer even if used with other factions,
             but his true potential is with the Chaos faction,
             especially alongside her sister Kayla and her ally Xe`sha.

    <h2>The Ashes Talisman for Aidan in Hero Wars Alliance</h2>

<p>The <strong>Ashes Talisman</strong> is a powerful enhancement for Aidan, significantly boosting his performance on the battlefield. Aidan can receive up to three slots of 6000 points of magic attack each, in addition to the initial benefits provided by the talisman.</p>

<h3>Initial Benefits</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Intelligence Increase</strong>: Aidan gains 2000 intelligence points.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Magic Attack Boost</strong>: Each point of intelligence adds 3 points to Aidan's magic attack. Therefore, the 2000 intelligence points translate to a total increase of 6000 points in magic attack.</li>
      <li><strong>Magic Defense Boost</strong>: Each point of intelligence also contributes 1 point to Aidan's magic defense, resulting in a total of 2000 points of magic defense.</li>
      <li><strong>Physical Attack Bonus</strong>: Although primarily a magic attacker, Aidan gains an additional 1 point of physical attack per intelligence point, adding 2000 points of physical attack, which enhances his basic attacks.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional Slots</h3>

<p>Aidan can further enhance his magic attack with three additional slots, each providing 6000 points of magic attack. This brings the potential total additional magic attack from the talisman to 18000 points.</p>

<h3>Healing and Shielding Enhancement</h3>

<p>Aidan's increased magic attack greatly enhances his healing capabilities. With higher magic attack, Aidan can heal much more effectively while providing a shield to the ally with the lowest health. This improvement makes him an even more valuable support character, capable of keeping his team alive longer in battles.</p>

<h3>Synergy with Kayla</h3>

<p>The talisman reinforces Aidan's synergy with his sister, Kayla. Both siblings have abilities that allow them to resurrect each other, and the increased magic attack from the talisman makes their resurrection skills more potent. This unique synergy can turn the tide of battle by bringing back key characters at critical moments.</p>

<h3>Chaos Faction Synergy</h3>

<p>The Ashes Talisman also enhances Aidan’s synergy with characters from the Chaos faction, particularly those with Sacrifice abilities. These characters can benefit from the increased magic attack and defense provided by Aidan’s talisman, allowing for more effective sacrifices and overall team strategy.</p>

<h3>Talisman Statistics</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Slot 0</strong>: Intelligence +2000</li>
  <li><strong>Slot 1</strong>: Magic Attack +6000</li>
  <li><strong>Slot 2</strong>: Magic Attack +6000</li>
  <li><strong>Slot 3</strong>: Magic Attack +6000</li>
  <li><strong>Additional Slots</strong>: Aidan can further enhance his capabilities with three more slots, each potentially adding up to 6000 points of magic attack.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Significance of the Ashes Talisman</h3>

<p>The Ashes Talisman significantly boosts Aidan’s overall performance by enhancing his magic attack, magic defense, and even providing a bonus to his physical attack. These improvements make Aidan a more formidable healer and support character, capable of providing better shields, stronger heals, and reinforcing his synergy with both his sister Kayla and other Chaos faction members. With the potential for three additional slots each adding up to 6000 points of magic attack, this talisman is an excellent choice for players looking to maximize Aidan’s potential in Hero Wars Alliance.</p>

    <h2>Final Conclusion of Aidan's Guide in Hero Wars</h2>

<p>Aidan and his sister Kayla emerged as the new heroes of the Chaos faction in 2023, bringing exceptional synergy and power comparable to the legendary combo of twins Krista and Lars. With Aidan's unique ability to resurrect Kayla and vice versa, their duo becomes unstoppable, ensuring a dominant presence on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Aidan's abilities are permeated with the keyword "sacrifice," demonstrating his commitment to sacrificing his own life for the good of his team. This mechanic aligns perfectly with heroes like Xe'sha, whose fourth ability, High Altaneira, grants a 25% magic attack bonus whenever an ally sacrifices life using abilities. The success of this combo in battles against the Hero Wars Mobile Hydras is evident, solidifying its position as a victorious strategy.</p>

<p>Although Aidan can play an effective role as a healer in other factions, his true potential is unlocked alongside his sister Kayla and allies like Xe'sha in the Chaos faction. His ability to sacrifice, resurrect, and heal make him an invaluable asset to any team seeking glory in the lands of Hero Wars.</p>
