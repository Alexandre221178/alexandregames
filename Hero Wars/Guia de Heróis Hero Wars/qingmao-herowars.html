  <h2>Detailed Tips for Each Reworked Skill</h2>

<h3>1. Qing Long (Gray Skill)</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Qing Mao summons a dragon spirit that strikes three nearby enemies, dealing physical damage with each hit. Each strike sets enemies on fire for 5 seconds, pushes them back, and inflicts burning damage over time.</p>

<!-- adx- joinads with lazy -->

<!-- adx- joinads with lazy -->


<ul>
    <li><strong>Damage per strike:</strong> 35% Physical Attack + 75 × Level</li>
    <li><strong>Burning damage per second:</strong> Physical Attack + 75 × Level</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Battle Impact:</strong></p>
<p>This skill is a powerhouse for dealing area damage and controlling enemy movement. The combination of burst and burn damage ensures that enemies take continuous punishment, making it particularly effective against clusters of enemies. Use this skill to weaken frontline Tanks and pressure fragile backline heroes simultaneously. Additionally, the pushback adds crowd control, giving your team extra breathing room to reposition or launch follow-up attacks.</p>

<h3>2. Spear of Dawn (Green Skill)</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Qing Mao blinds the nearest enemies for 4 seconds, causing their attacks to miss, and deals physical damage.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Damage:</strong> 40% Physical Attack + 30 × Level</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Battle Impact:</strong></p>  
<p>This skill is powerful for dealing area damage and controlling enemy movement. The combination of immediate damage and continuous burning ensures that enemies suffer constant punishment, making it particularly effective against groups of enemies. This ability weakens frontline Tanks and simultaneously pressures fragile backline heroes. Additionally, the pushback adds crowd control, giving your team more room to reposition or launch follow-up attacks.</p>

<h3>3. Dragon’s Claw (Blue Skill)</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Qing Mao deals physical damage to the nearest enemy based on their current health. This skill is particularly effective against high-health targets, as its damage scales with the enemy’s health pool.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Damage:</strong> 20% of the target’s current health</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Battle Impact:</strong></p>
<p>This ability makes Qing Mao a natural Tank killer. Against high-health enemies, such as Astaroth or Rufus, Qing Mao can strip their health significantly at the start of a fight, breaking down their defenses quickly. This skill ensures that enemy Tanks are no longer an insurmountable obstacle, opening a clear path for your team to target backline damage dealers and supports.</p>

<h3>4. Open Heart (Purple Skill)</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Every time Qing Mao strikes with a physical attack, she steals a portion of the target’s armor, weakening their defense. For every Way of Honor ally in the team, the armor steal effect is amplified. The stolen armor remains for the rest of the battle or until Qing Mao is defeated.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Armor steal per strike:</strong> 1.5% Physical Attack + 5 × Level</li>
    <li><strong>Additional armor steal per Way of Honor hero:</strong> 0.5% Physical Attack + 1 × Level</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Battle Impact:</strong></p>
<p>This skill provides both offensive and defensive utility, making Qing Mao a dual-threat hero. The armor-stealing effect not only amplifies her own damage but also makes enemies more vulnerable to allied physical attackers. The bonus armor steal from Way of Honor allies further enhances team synergy, creating opportunities for strategic compositions. Use this skill to counter high-armor teams, as it progressively weakens their defenses while boosting your team’s effectiveness throughout the fight.</p>
  
  <h2>Synergies with Honor Heroes</h2>
  <p>Qing Mao’s rework amplifies her synergy with other Way of Honor heroes, making her a key part of many compositions:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Tristan:</strong> His Armor penetration perfectly complements Qing Mao’s Armor-stealing, enabling relentless physical damage.</li>
      <li><strong>Soleil:</strong> Boosts team survivability and damage by redistributing stolen Armor and Magic defense.</li>
      <li><strong>Fafnir:</strong> Enhances crowd control with stuns and shields that sync well with Qing Mao’s Armor reduction.</li>
      <li><strong>Luther:</strong> Disrupts backlines, allowing Qing Mao to focus her damage output effectively.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Battlefield Impact Post-Rework</h2>
  <h3>Tank Slayer</h3>
  <p>Qing Mao excels at shredding frontline defenses with her Open Heart and Dragon’s Claw abilities. Tanks with high Armor stats will find it hard to withstand her relentless onslaught.</p>
  
  <h3>Control and Utility</h3>
  <p>Her upgraded Spear of Dawn blinds key damage dealers, providing a tactical edge. When paired with allies like Fafnir, she adds another layer of crowd control.</p>
  
  <h3>Balanced Offense and Support</h3>
  <p>By reducing enemy Armor and redistributing it among allies, Qing Mao brings a mix of offensive power and team utility, making her a valuable addition to most lineups.</p>
  
  <h2>Why the Rework Matters</h2>
  <p>Qing Mao’s rework transforms her from a niche hero into a formidable presence across all game modes. Her enhanced skills and synergies with Way of Honor heroes ensure she’s effective in PvE challenges and PvP battles alike. If you're looking for a hero that combines high damage, utility, and adaptability, Qing Mao’s rework makes her a top-tier choice.</p>

    <h2>Qing Mao's Talisman Guide</h2>
    <p>With Talisman, Qing Mao now receives 6000 critical chance points from her stats and 2000 agility points. Although critical chance alone is not enough, if Qing Mao is paired with Sebastian, Tristan, Oya, and other heroes who attack on the frontline, it will have a much more effective effect.
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of damage, the Talisman will affect her Ultimate, if Qing Mao significantly reduces enemy armor and hits enemies on the front line with critical damage with Sebastian present in her team, and armor penetration activated. Qing Mao will be able to destroy front-lines of entire enemies.

    <h2>Analysis of Qing Mao's Talismans in Hero Wars Alliance</h2>

<p>
    Qing Mao has two talismans that significantly enhance her combat effectiveness, each catering to distinct strategies: 
    <strong>The Talisman of Loss</strong> and <strong>The Kinship Talisman</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Talisman of Loss</h3>
<p>
    The Stone Talisman grants <strong>Agility</strong> and <strong>Critical Hit Chance</strong>, making Qing Mao a powerful damage dealer. 
    The added <strong>Critical Damage Chance</strong> allows her to deal double damage, significantly amplifying her offensive potential. 
</p>
<figure class="img-max">

    <caption>Talisman of Loss Stats</caption>

    <th>Slot</th>
    <th>Stats</th>
    <th>Points</th>

  </tr>

    <td>+2200</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>Critical Chance</td>
    <td>+2200</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>  
    This talisman is ideal for aggressive strategies, where maximizing her damage output is the priority. It pairs especially well with teams focused 
    on high burst damage, as her critical hits can quickly eliminate key enemy heroes. However, this talisman may leave her vulnerable to counters 
    from heroes like <strong>Helios</strong>, who specializes in punishing critical hits.
</p>

<h3>Kinship Talisman</h3>
<p>
    The Kinship Talisman provides <strong>Health</strong> and <strong>Physical Attack</strong>, which improve her overall survivability and damage. 
    Additionally, it enhances Qing Mao’s ability to <strong>reduce enemy armor</strong>, amplifying the damage dealt by her team, especially against 
    high-armor opponents.
</p>
<p>    
    This talisman is more suitable for defensive or balanced strategies, as the increased health makes her more durable in the 
    frontline, countering potential threats. It also protects her from counters like <strong>Helios</strong> or <strong>Amira</strong>, who thrive 
    against critical-hit-focused teams.
</p>

<figure class="img-max">

    <figcaption>Qing Mao with Talisman of Kinship, Hero Wars.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Recommendation</h3>
<p>
    <strong>For offense</strong>: Choose the <strong>Stone Talisman</strong> if you aim to maximize critical damage and deal devastating blows. 
    Avoid using this talisman against teams with critical hit counters, such as <strong>Helios</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>For defense</strong>: Opt for the <strong>Kinship Talisman</strong> when facing critical hit counters or if you want to improve 
    Qing Mao’s survivability while still supporting your team’s armor-breaking capabilities.
