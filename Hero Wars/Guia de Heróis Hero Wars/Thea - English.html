            <h3>Thea's Skill Set:</h3>
            
            <ol>
            <li><strong>Solar Sanctuary:</strong><br>
               Thea's first skill, Solar Sanctuary, is a boon to your team's survivability. It heals all members, providing a substantial amount of health regeneration based on Thea's Magic Attack and skill level.</li>
            
            
              
            
               <li><strong>Healing Beam:</strong><br>
               With Healing Beam, Thea targets the ally with the lowest health, offering targeted healing to keep your team in the fight. The potency of this heal scales with Thea's Magic Attack and skill level.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Vow of Silence:</strong><br>
               Vow of Silence is Thea's disruptive tool, silencing enemies for a significant duration. This skill not only neutralizes enemy spellcasting but also deals damage based on Thea's Magic Attack and skill level.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Second Wind:</strong><br>
               Second Wind complements Thea's healing abilities by increasing the skill speed of healed allies. This buff allows your team to unleash their abilities more frequently, giving you a strategic advantage in prolonged battles.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Strategies for Thea:</h3>
            
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Synergy with Jhu:</strong><br>
              One of Thea's standout qualities is her ability to accelerate allied heroes' skill speed by 50% every time she heals them. This synergy pairs exceptionally well with heroes like Jhu, particularly in battles against Hydra bosses. Thea's ultimate rage not only heals the team but also accelerates their skill speed, allowing for relentless assaults on the enemy.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Disruption and Utility:</strong><br>
              While Thea may not excel as the primary healer, her Vow of Silence provides valuable crowd control by silencing enemies. This can disrupt enemy strategies and create openings for your team to capitalize on. Additionally, her Healing Beam ensures that critical allies stay in the fight, mitigating potential threats.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Strategic Deployment:</strong><br>
              When incorporating Thea into your team, consider the specific challenges you'll face in each battle. Her versatile skill set allows for adaptability in various scenarios, from prolonged engagements to burst-focused encounters. Understanding when to utilize each of her abilities can be the difference between victory and defeat.</li>
            </ul>

    <div>    <h2>Thea vs Hydra  </h2>   
        <p>Thea is a great hero against hydras, her fourth purple ability causes Thea to accelerate her allies every time she heals them, so it is a good combination with Jhu and Mojo to deal more damage to Hero Wars hydras; this combo is one of the best against fire hydras; every 11 seconds or every time she recharges energy Thea will heal Jhu and speed up by 50%.
        </p>
