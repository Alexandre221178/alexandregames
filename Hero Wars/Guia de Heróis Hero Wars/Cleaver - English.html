        Cleaver has always been a very difficult hero to get, as it is only possible to get it by opening the heroic chest and acquiring it with the number of absolute stars, which are 6. With the new update after opening 400 heroic chests, a great reward will be delivered, and the first reward will be the Cleaver, the other rewards are super skins+.

    <h2>Strategy on how to use Cleaver</h2>

    

        <p>As one of the tanks in the Chaos faction Cleaver becomes a great ally for new heroes Aidan and Kayla making strong arena teams, in addition to being great on other teams as well.

        </p>

        <!-- adx- joinads with lazy -->
<div joinadscode="Content2" lazyload="true"></div>
<!-- adx- joinads with lazy -->

      
        
        <p>Cleaver uses his ax to pull enemies that are positioned on the back line, making them easy targets to annihilate, as these enemies do not have enough defense to block in front of a tank, and that of Cleaver is a very feared tank for those who are not prepared to face it.

        </p>


        <p>As a tank, Cleaver is very strong in Hero Wars Mobile and certainly can be a strong ally in your team.

    <h2>Cleaver Talisman Guide</h2>
    <h3>Cleaver Talisman of Decomposition</h3>
<p>
    The Cleaver Talisman of Decomposition in Hero Wars Alliance is a crucial piece for boosting the Cleaver hero's power, providing significant increases in Strength and Health stats. This strategic addition not only extends the Cleaver's durability on the battlefield but also intensifies its offensive impact.
</p>
<p>
    When equipping the Cleaver Talisman, the player will experience a notable increase in Strength and Health stats. This improvement not only strengthens the hero's ability to deal with damage but also increases his resistance, making him more resilient in the face of enemy attacks. The combination of these benefits contributes to Cleaver's more robust presence in clashes.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, the additional Strength gained from Talisman is especially valuable, as this increase synergizes with Cleaver's violet passive ability. This results in a unique synergy, where each additional point of Strength not only strengthens your physical attacks but is also reflected in a corresponding increase in Health. This cycle of mutual empowerment creates an upward spiral of power for Cleaver.
</p>
<p>
    By enhancing strength and health gains, the Cleaver Talisman contributes to the optimization of all the Cleaver's abilities. This means that as the Cleaver becomes more powerful, its active and passive abilities benefit proportionally, resulting in a more impactful and effective overall performance in combat.
</p>
<p>
    In short, the Cleaver Talisman of Decomposition plays a key role in hero enhancement, offering substantial increases in Strength and Health stats. With its unique ability to reinforce the Force and enhance all of Cleaver's abilities, this talisman becomes a valuable strategic choice for those seeking to maximize the power of this formidable warrior in the Hero Wars Alliance universe.

    <h3>Cleaver Talisman of Butcher</h3>
    <p>
        The Cleaver Talisman of Butcher is a powerful artifact that enhances the capabilities of its wielder in combat. This talisman grants the Cleaver the Crushing statistic and provides three additional slots of Toughness, which can be further improved through the Reroll mechanic. These attributes make the Cleaver Talisman of Butcher an essential tool for any hero looking to dominate the battlefield.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Crushing</strong> is a unique statistic that increases all outgoing damage to enemies with low health. This effect applies to all damage types, including Physical, Magical, and Pure damage. However, it does not affect health loss caused by allied skills. The formula for calculating the increased damage is as follows: <em>(Crushing / (Crushing + target's main stat)) * 100%</em>. This means that the higher the Crushing statistic, the more damage the hero can inflict on weakened enemies, making it easier to finish them off.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to Crushing, the Cleaver Talisman of Butcher also provides <strong>Toughness</strong>. This statistic reduces all incoming damage from enemies when the hero's health is low. Like Crushing, Toughness applies to all damage types (Physical, Magical, and Pure) but does not affect health loss from allied abilities. The formula for determining the percentage of damage reduction is: <em>(Toughness / (Toughness + enemy’s main stat)) × 100%</em>. This means that the higher the Toughness statistic, the more damage the hero can withstand when their health is critically low, increasing their survivability in intense battles.
    </p>
    <p>
        The combination of Crushing and Toughness makes the Cleaver Talisman of Butcher a versatile and powerful artifact. It not only enhances the hero's offensive capabilities but also provides crucial defensive benefits. The three additional slots of Toughness can be further improved through the Reroll mechanic, allowing players to customize the talisman to suit their playstyle and strategy. Whether you're looking to deal massive damage to weakened enemies or survive longer in tough fights, the Cleaver Talisman of Butcher is an invaluable asset.

                <p>In Cleaver glyphs prioritize Armor and then level up health and strength to improve your Putrefaction skill and give more survivability, lastly magic defense and physical attack.

                <h3>Artifacts Priority</h3>
                <p>In Cleaver Artifacts, priority should be given to the Book to gain armor and magic defense, then the Ring to gain more life and physical attack, finally the Weapon, even though it is armor for the whole team, it depends on being activated to work and can take time.

                    </p>
            <ol class="check-list">

           <h3>Skins Priority</h3>
           <p>
               Cleaver's skins should be upgraded in a way that maximizes his durability and damage potential. The new <strong><a href="../../hero-wars-alliance/review/new-stats-in-hero-wars-alliance-en.html">Toughness skin</a></strong> is a crucial addition, as it provides significant damage reduction when Cleaver’s health is low. This makes him much harder to take down, especially in prolonged fights.
           </p>
           <p>
               Prioritize upgrading <strong>Armor</strong> first to improve Cleaver's survivability against physical attacks. Next, level up <strong>Health</strong> to further enhance his tanking abilities. <strong>Strength</strong> should follow, as it increases both health and physical attack, making Cleaver more effective in battle. 
           </p>
           <p>
            The <strong>Toughness</strong> skin should be upgraded next, as its damage reduction effect ensures Cleaver stays in the fight longer, especially when facing high burst damage. After that, upgrade <strong>Magical Defense</strong> to mitigate magical threats, and finally, enhance <strong>Physical Attack</strong> to boost his offensive potential.
           </p>
       <ol class="check-list">
           <li>Armor</li>
           <li>Health</li>
