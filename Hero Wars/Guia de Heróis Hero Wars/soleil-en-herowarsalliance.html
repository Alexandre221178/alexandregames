<h2>Hero Wars Alliance: Complete Guide to Soleil</h2>

<p>Soleil is a powerful priest who has managed to defeat even a deity, and now he is ready to join the ranks of the Guardians in the battle against chaos. Reflecting control effects, weakening enemies, and strengthening allies make Soleil a vital part of any team.</p>



<h3>Artifacts:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Prison of the Ancient God:</strong> Magic Attack</li>
    <li><strong>Tome of Arcane Knowledge:</strong> Magic Attack + Health</li>
    <li><strong>Ring of Intelligence:</strong> Intelligence</li>
</ul>

<h3>Soleil Skills:</h3>

<h4>1ª Curse of the Ancient God</h4>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Casts the Curse of the Ancient God on the nearest enemy for a certain amount of time, stealing Armor and Magic Defense from them and dealing damage. The Armor and Magic Defense stolen from the enemy are temporarily and evenly distributed among all allies.</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong> Use this skill to debilitate strong enemy tanks and boost your team's overall defense. Timing this skill correctly can significantly weaken enemy frontline heroes, making it easier for your damage dealers to penetrate their defenses.</p>

<h4>2ª Halo</h4>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Temporarily envelops the frontmost ally in a magical halo, reducing the damage they take. The ally with the halo cannot be stunned, blinded, or silenced. If an enemy tries to stun, blind, or silence the haloed ally, the effect will rebound onto the enemy themselves for 3 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong> Use Halo on your main tank or any crucial frontline hero to ensure they stay in the fight longer and avoid being controlled. This skill is particularly effective against teams that rely heavily on control abilities.</p>

<h4>3ª Mark of the Ancient God</h4>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Applies the Mark of the Ancient God to the central enemy for a certain amount of time. The enemy takes damage with each use of their abilities and takes additional damage for using control abilities against heroes.</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong> Target the enemy’s main damage dealer or control hero with this mark to punish them for using their abilities. This skill can disrupt the enemy's strategy and force them to rethink their approach.</p>

<h4>4ª Blessing of the Ancient God</h4>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Temporarily increases damage from physical and magical attacks, as well as healing, to all allies in front of Soleil. Additionally, increases damage and healing for each control ability applied by enemies since the beginning of the battle.</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong> Position Soleil strategically so that the maximum number of allies benefits from this buff. This skill scales with the number of control abilities used by the enemy, making it more effective in prolonged battles.</p>

<h3>Strategies for Using Soleil:</h3>

<h4>Synergy with Allies</h4>
<p>Pair Soleil with heroes like Qing Mao, Markus, and Ishmael to maximize the synergy within the Way of Honor faction. These heroes can benefit greatly from Soleil’s buffs and protection.</p>

<h4>Positioning</h4>
<p>As a middle-line hero, Soleil should be placed where he can support both the frontline and backline heroes effectively. Ensure he is protected but still close enough to apply his buffs and debuffs.</p>




<h4>Maximize Artifact Usage</h4>
<p>Focus on boosting Soleil’s Intelligence to enhance his magic attack power and overall effectiveness. Prioritize leveling up his artifacts to make his skills more impactful.</p>

<p>By leveraging Soleil’s unique abilities to weaken enemies and strengthen allies, you can turn the tide of battle in your favor. Use his skills strategically to disrupt enemy plans and empower your team, making Soleil an indispensable part of your Hero Wars Alliance lineup.</p>
