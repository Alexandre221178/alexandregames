                <h2>Comprehensive Guide: Strategies for Using Helios in Hero Wars Alliance</h2>
                <p>Hero Wars Alliance offers a variety of heroes, each with unique abilities and gameplay strategies. Among these heroes, Helios stands out as one of the best supports in the game, with his ability "Flaming Retribution" being particularly effective against teams that rely on critical damage. In this guide, we'll explore advanced strategies to make the most of Helios's potential on your team, from using him in attacks to his role as a counter for specific teams.</p>
            



                <h3>Getting to Know Helios</h3>
                <p>Helios is a versatile hero who can be used for both defense and offense. His ability "Flaming Retribution" is what makes him so valuable, as it deals damage to enemies who rely on critical attacks, making him an effective counter against teams that rely on this strategy. Although more effective in attacks, he can also be used defensively in specific situations.</p>
            
                <h3>Attack Strategies with Helios</h3>
                <p>When assembling an attack team, Helios can be a crucial addition, especially against teams that abuse critical attacks. Here are some strategies to maximize the use of Helios in attacks:</p>
                
                
                
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Combination with Corvus:</strong> Helios works exceptionally well in combination with the tank Corvus. Helios's "Flaming Retribution" ability, combined with Corvus's "Altar of Souls" ability, can be devastating against current meta teams such as Yasmine, Tristan, Oya, and Fafnir. This combination is especially effective for neutralizing the assassin Yasmine, protected by Fafnir's shields and Oya's healing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on Critical Damage:</strong> When facing teams that heavily rely on critical attacks, concentrate your efforts on neutralizing these attacks with the help of Helios. Position him strategically to maximize the impact of his "Flaming Retribution" ability and reduce the potential for critical damage from the enemy team.</li>
                    <li><strong>Investment Priority:</strong> Investing in Helios is a smart choice, especially if your team frequently faces teams that abuse critical attacks. Increasing Helios's level and equipment can make him even more effective as a counter against these teams.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>Defense Strategies with Helios</h3>
                <p>Although Helios is more commonly used in attacks, he can also play a defensive role in certain situations. Here are some strategies for using Helios in your defense:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Against Critical Attack Teams:</strong> If you're facing a team that heavily relies on critical attacks, include Helios in your defensive formation. His "Flaming Retribution" ability can discourage enemies from using critical attacks, providing an additional layer of protection for your team.</li>
                    <li><strong>Support for Tanks:</strong> Helios can also be useful as support for your tanks, providing additional damage to enemies and helping to take down opponents more quickly. Position him strategically to maximize his impact and help your team maintain the defensive line.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>Investing in Helios</h3>
                <p>Investing in Helios can be a wise decision to improve your team's performance, especially if you frequently face teams that rely on critical attacks. Here are some areas to focus your investments in Helios:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Star Level:</strong> Increasing Helios's star level can enhance his combat effectiveness, providing additional statistics and increasing damage on abilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Equipping Helios with the best available equipment can further improve his abilities and make him more resistant to enemy attacks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Abilities:</strong> As you level up, prioritize Helios's abilities that increase his ability to deal damage to enemies, especially those related to his "Flaming Retribution" ability.</li>
                </ul>

        <p>Helios is a reasonable hero to use on physical damage hydras as a defense, 
            but don't expect too much from Helios on hydra teams,
             as his strength is against critical damage and hydras do not deal critical damage.
