        <h2>Unleashing the Power of Oya: A Guide to Dominating with the New Hero in Hero Wars Alliance</h2> 
               

        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>The arrival of Oya in Hero Wars Alliance has stirred up uproar among players, and for good reason. This formidable addition to the Nature faction brings with her a unique set of skills that can turn the tide of arena battles. In this guide, we'll delve into strategies on how to harness Oya's abilities effectively to counter top meta teams and emerge victorious.</p>

        <h3>Understanding Oya's Abilities:</h3>
        <p>Oya's kit is designed to disrupt enemy formations and empower allied heroes, particularly those who excel at dealing critical damage. Let's break down her abilities:</p>

      
       
       
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Shield Breaker:</strong> Oya's first ability deals damage to the nearest enemy, with additional damage inflicted on all marked enemies. Notably, shielded enemies are particularly vulnerable to Oya's attacks, as they take increased damage. This ability also grants Oya energy if she eliminates an enemy with it.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Hunting:</strong> With Hunting, Oya marks an enemy as her "prey" and draws them towards her. Any attack on the marked target results in the burning of their energy. This ability not only sets up Oya for subsequent attacks but also weakens the targeted enemy, making them easier to eliminate.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Overwhelming:</strong> Oya's third ability showcases her agility and ferocity as she unleashes a series of quick strikes on her foes. With each successive hit, the damage inflicted on the enemy increases. Additionally, enemies positioned behind the main target also suffer from the skill's damage, making it a potent tool for damaging multiple opponents simultaneously.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Brutal Onslaught:</strong> This passive ability reinforces Oya's role as a support hero for critical damage dealers. Whenever an allied hero deals critical damage or breaks an enemy shield, they receive healing. Furthermore, allied Nature heroes benefit from an increased bonus, enhancing their effectiveness in battle.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Effective Strategies for Utilizing Oya:</h3>
        <p>Now that we've familiarized ourselves with Oya's abilities, let's explore some strategies for maximizing her impact on the battlefield:</p>

        <ol>
        <li><strong>Target Selection:</strong> Oya's Hunting ability allows her to select a priority target and draw them into the fray. When choosing the marked target, prioritize high-value enemies such as healers or damage dealers. By isolating and weakening key threats, Oya can tilt the odds in your favor.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Synergy with Critical Damage Dealers:</strong> Pair Oya with heroes who excel at dealing critical damage to capitalize on her passive buffs. Heroes like Yasmine or DareDevil can benefit greatly from Oya's support, as they receive healing and increased critical strike chances when dealing critical damage or breaking shields.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Disruption and Crowd Control:</strong> Oya's abilities are excellent tools for disrupting enemy formations and controlling the flow of battle. Use Shield Breaker to target shielded enemies and weaken their defenses, while Overwhelming can deal significant damage to clustered foes. Coordinate Oya's attacks with other crowd control abilities for maximum impact.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Adaptability in Team Composition:</strong> Consider building a team composition that complements Oya's strengths. Allies with critical hit chance or healing abilities can further enhance her effectiveness, while Nature faction heroes receive additional bonuses from her passive skills. Experiment with different combinations to find the synergy that best suits your playstyle.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Dominate the Arena</h3>
        <p>Oya brings a refreshing dynamic to Hero Wars Alliance with her unique abilities and synergies. By understanding her strengths and employing effective strategies, you can harness her power to overcome formidable opponents and dominate the arena.</p>

            <h2>Oya Tips from the Hero Wars Devs!</h2>


            <h3>1. Duration of Mark:</h3>
            <p>Ever wondered how long Oya's mark stays on her target? Well, wonder no more! The mark remains until the next time the ability is used or until it is removed by other means. Keep this in mind when planning your strategy on the battlefield.</p>

            <h3>2. Interaction with Iris:</h3>
            <p>Have you noticed a peculiar interaction between Oya's second skill and Iris's third skill? When Oya targets Iris with her second skill, Iris won't put her third skill's debuff on Oya, despite the presence of the keyword "Mark." Why does this happen? It's because Iris debuffs opponents based on the tags on her allies, not herself. Understanding this interaction can be crucial in battles against teams featuring Iris.</p>

            <h3>3. Multi-Target Attacks:</h3>
            <p>Curious about Oya's potential to wreak havoc on multiple targets at once? Rest assured, she can indeed hit several targets on the field simultaneously. This makes her a formidable force in disrupting enemy formations and dealing damage across the board. Use this to your advantage when facing off against clustered foes.</p>

            <h3>4. The Ancient Prophecy:</h3>
            <p>Have you ever wondered about the ancient prophecy that Oya seeks to fulfill? Delve into the lore of Hero Wars Alliance as you uncover the secrets of Oya's past. The life of Oya's tribe was steeped in rituals and prophecies, one of which foretold Oya receiving the Ancestor's Sword and becoming the last chief of her tribe. What exactly this prophecy entails for Oya is a mystery waiting to be unraveled.</p>

            <p>By heeding these tips from the developers, you'll be well-equipped to harness the full potential of Oya in your battles. Whether you're strategizing in the arena or embarking on epic quests, Oya's power will be yours to command. So, rally your allies, sharpen your blades, and prepare to conquer with Oya by your side!</p>

    <h3>Oya Talisman Overall Impact</h3>
    <p>Equipping Oya with the talisman of prophecy significantly boosts her combat effectiveness. The 2000-point increase in strength translates to substantial gains in physical attack and health, improving her offensive and defensive capabilities. Additionally, the three critical hit chance slots, each providing 2200 points, ensure that Oya can deliver devastating critical strikes, particularly effective against shielded enemies. This makes Oya a formidable force on the battlefield, capable of dealing lethal damage to her adversaries.</p>

        <p><b>How long does her mark stay on?</p></b>

</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="Lucca">
    <blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/herowarsalliance" author="Nexters Global Hero Wars Alliance">
        <p><b>I notice that if Oya's 2nd skill targets Iris, Iris won't put her 3rd skill's debuff on Oya even though there's a keyword "Mark". Why is that?</p></b>
            <p>It happens this way because Iris debuffs opponents because of the tags on her allies, not herself.</p>     
</blockquote>

<div class="Lucca">
    <blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/herowarsalliance" author="Nexters Global Hero Wars Alliance">

        <p><b>What is this ancient prophecy that Oya wants to fulfil?</p></b>
            <p>The life of the tribe Oya lived in was based on rituals and prophecies. One of these prophecies was about Oya receiving Ancestor's Sword and becoming the last chief of the tribe. And what exactly this prophecy is about Oya is yet to find out.</p>
