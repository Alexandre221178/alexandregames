            <h2>Comprehensive Guide: How to Utilize Keira in Hero Wars Alliance</h2>
            <p>Keira is a powerful heroine in Hero Wars Alliance, capable of dealing significant damage on the battlefield when used correctly. With versatile abilities and the ability to synergize with different heroes and factions, Keira is a popular choice for high-level teams. In this guide, we'll explore how to make the most of Keira's potential, including her ideal combinations, team strategies, and usage tips.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction to Keira</h2>
            <p>Keira is an agile assassin who stands out for her ultimate ability, Over-Power, capable of dealing massive amounts of damage to enemies. Her effectiveness is even greater when combined with heroes that grant critical damage bonuses to the team. With the recent adjustment to her fourth ability and the introduction of a new physical damage skin, Keira has become an unstoppable force on the battlefield.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Powerful Combos</h2>
            <h3>1. Fafnir and Keira</h3>
            <p>A classic combo, Fafnir provides protection to Keira through his shield, making her more resilient and able to survive longer on the battlefield. This is especially useful when facing enemy teams with high damage potential.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Jet and Keira</h3>
            <p>Jet is a valuable ally for Keira, as his abilities add critical damage to Keira's skills, thus increasing her damage potential. This combination makes Keira even deadlier, especially in direct confrontations.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Dorian, Fafnir, and Keira</h3>
            <p>This combo offers both protection and sustain to Keira. While Fafnir provides the protective shield, Dorian offers vampirism to the team, allowing Keira to heal herself while dealing damage to enemies. It's a highly effective combination in prolonged battles of attrition.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Eternal Faction Allies</h3>
            <p>Keira benefits greatly from being used with allies from the Eternal Faction, such as Morrigan and Corvus. Their synergies further increase Keira's damage and survival potential, making her a formidable choice for Chaos faction-focused teams.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Usage Strategies</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Positioning:</strong> Strategically position Keira on the battlefield, preferably behind tanks or more resilient heroes. This helps protect her from enemy attacks while she deals long-range damage.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Timing of Ultimate Ability:</strong> Keira's ultimate ability, Over-Power, is crucial for dealing massive amounts of damage. Wait for the right moment to activate it, ideally when enemies are grouped together or when a crucial enemy hero is unprotected.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Utilize Synergies:</strong> Maximize Keira's potential by leveraging synergies with other heroes on your team. Heroes that grant critical damage buffs, protection, or healing can significantly increase her effectiveness on the battlefield.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Counter-Attack:</strong> Keira is most effective when used as part of an aggressive strategy. Use her to counter-attack and eliminate vulnerable enemy heroes, dealing as much damage as possible before they have a chance to react.
            </p>

                <h3>3rd Ability: Dancing Blades</h3>

            <h2>Keira's Talisman Guide</h2>
            <p>With the talisman, Keira receives an increase in her Agility stat, receiving more Physical Attack and Armor. At the maximum level, it will increase physical attack by +18,000 points, and another 2,000 points of armor, adding up to a total of 17,449 points of protection against armor penetration, reducing the enemies' physical attack damage, so it will become quite strong.
            </p>
            <p>With the talisman's physical attack bonus, Keira will be able to do more physical damage to enemies, and it will certainly be difficult to stop her when she launches her whirlwind of blades at the enemy team.

    <p>
        In Keira's glyphs, level up armor penetration first to deal more damage. Then, prioritize health to survive, especially against Corvus' altar. Then physical attack and agility to increase damage in skills, and finally armor.

                <h3>Artifacts Priority</h3>

<p>
    In artifacts, the priority is the book because Keira gains more armor penetration, and she needs a lot of armor penetration to cause a lot of damage. Then climb the ring to gain agility which will increase your physical attack points and armor. Lastly leveling up Keira's weapon artifact because it increases the physical attack of Keira and her allies.

                <h3>Skins Priority</h3>
<p>
    In Keira's skins, start by leveling up armor penetration, then the super skin, because it increases physical attack and is worth two skins. Third: physical attack, and fourth agility to gain more physical attack and armor.
</p>
<p>
    Lastly, level up the magical defense skin, Keira is powerful against wizard teams with this skin, especially if combined with Fafnir's shield, it allows her to survive Satori's attack, gaining energy and launching her Ultimate at enemies.  </p>
