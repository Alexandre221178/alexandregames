        <h2>Strategy on How to Play with Chang'e</h2>
  <p>Chang'e is a powerful mage in Mobile Legends with great burst damage and crowd control abilities. Understanding her skills and how to use them effectively is key to mastering her gameplay.</p>


  <h3>Chang'e Skills in Mobile Legends</h3>
  
  <h4>Passive: Trouble Maker</h4>
  <p>Each time Chang'e deals damage to an enemy, she leaves a mark on them. Each mark increases her next skill's damage to the enemy by 2% (up to 40%).</p>
  
  <h4>1st Skill: Starmoon Shockwave</h4>
  <p>Chang'e sends an energy sphere in the target direction, dealing magic damage to enemies in its path and slowing them.</p>
  <p>Crescent Moon: Sends 4 extra energy spheres along with Chang'e's, each dealing damage and slowing enemies hit. The slow effect can stack.</p>

  <h4>2nd Skill: Crescent Moon</h4>
  <p>Chang'e summons the Crescent Moon, gaining a shield and movement speed. Enhances Chang'e's skills and allows her basic attacks to deal additional magic damage.</p>
  <p>Reduces the cooldown of this skill each time Chang'e deals magic damage with her basic attacks and skills.</p>

  <div class="img-middle">

    <a>Crescent Moon Ability and Marks of Change.</a>
</div>

  <h4>3rd Skill: Meteor Shower</h4>
  <p>Chang'e fires 30 meteors in the target direction over 4s, each dealing damage to the first enemy hit. Deals extra damage to minions and creeps. Chang'e also gains movement speed for the duration.</p>
  <p>Crescent Moon: Fires meteors along with Chang'e, each dealing damage.</p>

    <a>Changes' Ultimate Meteor Shower, MLBB.</a>
</div>

  <h3>Tips for Playing Chang'e</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Skill Combo:</strong> Start with Crescent Moon to gain the shield and enhanced basic attacks. Follow up with Meteor Shower for massive AOE damage. Use Starmoon Shockwave after Crescent Moon for extra damage and crowd control.</li>
    <li><strong>Positioning:</strong> Stay behind your team and use your long-range abilities to poke enemies and stay safe. Chang'e is squishy, so avoid getting caught out of position.</li>
    <li><strong>Cooldown Management:</strong> Use basic attacks and skills to reduce the cooldown of Crescent Moon, allowing you to use it more frequently for the shield and movement speed buff.</li>
    <li><strong>Objective Control:</strong> Chang'e's Ultimate deals extra damage to minions and monsters, making her great for securing objectives like Turtle and Lord. Coordinate with your team to maximize its effectiveness.</li>
    <li><strong>Itemization:</strong> Items that enhance magic damage and cooldown reduction are crucial for Chang'e. Items like Clock of Destiny, Divine Glaive, and Concentrated Energy can greatly increase her damage output.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Additional Tips for Playing Chang'e</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Engagement Timing:</strong> Chang'e is strong in prolonged team fights where she can continuously apply damage and crowd control. Look for opportunities to engage when the enemy is grouped up to maximize the effectiveness of her AOE abilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Awareness of Enemies:</strong> Keep an eye on enemy movements and abilities, especially crowd control skills. Chang'e is vulnerable to crowd control, so try to avoid getting caught in them by staying at a safe distance.</li>
    <li><strong>Map Awareness:</strong> Pay attention to the map and objectives. Chang'e can quickly clear minion waves and provide support in team fights, but be ready to rotate to help secure objectives when needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Combo with Teammates:</strong> Chang'e works well with heroes who can engage and disrupt the enemy team, such as tanks or fighters. Coordinate with your team to chain your abilities for maximum impact.</li>
    <li><strong>Adaptation:</strong> Adjust your build and playstyle based on the enemy team composition. If they have a lot of crowd control, consider items like Immortality or Athena's Shield to increase survivability.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>By mastering Chang'e's skills, positioning, and team coordination, you can become a formidable force on the battlefield in Mobile Legends. Practice her mechanics, stay aware of your surroundings, and always be ready to adapt to the ever-changing flow of the game.</p>

        <h2>Chang'e: Positives and Negatives</h2>
    
        
        <h3>Positive Points</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ranged Damage: Chang'e excels at dealing damage from a distance, allowing her to poke enemies and stay relatively safe during team fights.</li>
          <li>Shield: Her Crescent Moon skill provides a shield, granting her extra survivability in battles.</li>
          <li>Movement Speed: Chang'e can gain increased movement speed from her skills, helping her maneuver around the battlefield and escape dangerous situations.</li>
          <li>Buff to Skills: Her Crescent Moon skill enhances her other abilities, making them more effective in combat.</li>
          <li>Strong Against Lord and Turtle: Chang'e's Ultimate, Meteor Shower, deals extra damage to minions and monsters, making her valuable for securing objectives like Lord and Turtle.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Negative Points</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Little Defense: Despite the shield from Crescent Moon, Chang'e lacks significant defensive abilities, making her vulnerable to burst damage.</li>
          <li>Weak Against Assassins: Chang'e's low defense and lack of mobility skills make her an easy target for assassins who can quickly close the gap and eliminate her.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Understanding these strengths and weaknesses can help you play Chang'e more effectively, focusing on her strengths while mitigating her vulnerabilities.</p>

        <h2>Chang'e in Battles</h2>
        <h3>Best Allies:</h3> 
        <p>In battle, Chang'e does very well with tank allies (Tigreal, Atlas, Hylos, Minotaur, Lolita, and Grock), with the ability to concentrate enemies in a single place. This way, Chang'e can use her second ability to buff her Ultimate and deal a lot of damage to enemies at once.</p>

            <h3>Emblem: Impure Rage</h3>

    <h2>Story of Chang'e in Mobile Legends</h2>


    <div class="skillgray">
        <blockquote  >
            Chang'e is the youngest disciple of the Great Dragon. Since
Early on, she displayed incredible magical potential, mastering
quickly the Great Dragon's greatest spell - The Satellite
Sacred. From then on, Chang'e won the undying love of the
Great Dragon. However, Chang'e had a
energetic and fun personality that gave the Great
Dragon some headaches. Finally, he asked
Zilong, his adopted son, to take care of Chang'e. The big
Dragon was hopeful that the diligent character and
Zilong's determination could help guide Chang'e. Serious
as Zilong was, yet he came to love the vibrant and
smart Chang'e like her little sister. They used to
spend countless hours together practicing magic. Zilong
found the moon rabbit and gave it to Chang'e as a gift.
Zilong hoped that one day Chang'e would discover the strength of
divine rabbit and, with his help, she improved her magical ability. Chang'e read Zilong's mind and took good care of the Moon Rabbit, accompanying him every day.
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote  >
            During the second Plains War, Zilong helped the
            wise rulers of the earth, traveling between worlds. After
            Once he was gone, Chang'e went back to his old ways
            perverse and childish, where even the Moon Rabbit did
            something bad every now and then. At this point, the Great
            Dragon was no longer sure if there would be another day
            of peace - that is, until the Moon Rabbit swallowed one of
                        his sacred pills by accident, thinking it was sweet. The Great Dragon immediately threw the Moon Rabbit out of its sanctuary. To everyone's surprise, the Moon Rabbit rebelled against the Great Dragon again. At the exact moment the Great Dragon was taking his life.
                        Chang'e saved the Rabbit and decided to help Zilong make up for his mistake together with the Moon Rabbit. Even so, the Great Dragon felt obliged to give Chang'e his precious Crescent Moon to protect her.
