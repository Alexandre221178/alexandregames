  <h2>Analysis of Harith's Skills and Strategic Usage in Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</h2>

<h3>1. Passive - Key Insight</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Harith gains 7% Hybrid Lifesteal for each nearby enemy hero, stacking up to 35%.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Engage in team fights where multiple enemy heroes are present to maximize lifesteal. This passive makes Harith more sustainable in prolonged skirmishes, allowing him to recover health rapidly as he deals damage.</p>

<h3>2. Synchro Fission (Skill 1)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cooldown:</strong> 5.0 seconds</li>
    <li><strong>Mana Cost:</strong> 50</li>
    <li><strong>Base Damage:</strong> 224 (+80% Total Magic Power)</li>
    <li><strong>Explosion Damage:</strong> 560 (+200% Total Magic Power)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Harith creates a phantom that releases Synchro Fission toward each other, dealing damage to enemies in their path and creating an explosion upon collision.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Use Synchro Fission to poke and harass enemies from a safe distance. Position yourself to ensure the phantom and Harith's paths intersect where enemies are concentrated to maximize the explosion damage. This skill is highly effective for wave clearing and zoning enemies during team fights.</p>




<h3>3. Chrono Dash (Skill 2)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cooldown:</strong> 9.3 seconds</li>
    <li><strong>Mana Cost:</strong> 40</li>
    <li><strong>Shield:</strong> 120 (+130% Total Magic Power)</li>
    <li><strong>Enhanced Basic Attack Damage:</strong> 225 (+100% Total Physical Attack)(+100% Total Magic Power)</li>
    <li><strong>Slow Effect:</strong> 40%</li>
    <li><strong>Cooldown Reduction on Hit:</strong> 3 seconds</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Harith dashes in a target direction, gaining a shield and enhancing his next basic attack to deal additional damage and slow enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Utilize Chrono Dash for mobility, both offensively and defensively. Engage and disengage quickly in fights, using the shield to mitigate incoming damage. Aim to hit enemies with the enhanced basic attack to reduce the cooldown of Chrono Dash, allowing for more frequent dashes. This skill synergizes well with his ultimate, Zaman Force, to keep enemies controlled.</p>

<h3>4. Zaman Force (Ultimate)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cooldown:</strong> 40.0 seconds</li>
    <li><strong>Mana Cost:</strong> 120</li>
    <li><strong>Slow Effect:</strong> 70% initially, 35% continuously</li>
    <li><strong>Cooldown Reduction on Contact:</strong> Synchro Fission by 1 second, Chrono Dash by 3 seconds</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Harith summons a multidimensional rift that significantly slows enemies and reduces the cooldown of his skills when he comes into contact with it using Chrono Dash.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Activate Zaman Force to dominate team fights and skirmishes. The initial slow is highly effective for catching out enemies and disrupting their positioning. Use Chrono Dash within the rift to continually reduce skill cooldowns, allowing Harith to spam his abilities. The resilience gained within the rift makes him harder to crowd control, providing an edge in fights.</p>

<h3>Combination and Synergy</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> Start with Zaman Force to slow enemies and create a favorable battleground. Use Chrono Dash to engage, gaining a shield and dealing damage with the enhanced basic attack. Follow up with Synchro Fission to deal significant burst damage, aiming for the explosion.</li>
    <li><strong>Sustained Fight:</strong> Utilize the cooldown reduction from Chrono Dash and Zaman Force to continuously cycle through skills. The lifesteal from Key Insight will keep Harith healthy during prolonged engagements.</li>
    <li><strong>Mobility and Escape:</strong> In case of unfavorable fights, use Chrono Dash to retreat, utilizing the shield for protection. The ultimate can also slow enemies to aid in disengaging.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Skill Upgrading Priority</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Synchro Fission: Maximize first for damage and wave clear.</li>
    <li>Chrono Dash: Upgrade second for mobility, shield strength, and cooldown reduction.</li>
    <li>Zaman Force: Upgrade when available to enhance overall combat effectiveness.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Further Insights</h3>
<p>Harith excels in both burst damage and sustained fights due to his ability to reduce skill cooldowns and lifesteal from enemies. Proper positioning, skill timing, and leveraging his mobility are key to mastering Harith and maximizing his potential in battles.</p>

  <h2>Harith in Mobile Legends: Bang Bang - Pros and Cons</h2>

<h3>Harith Pros:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>High Mobility:</strong> Harith's Chrono Dash allows him to move quickly around the battlefield, making it easy to engage, disengage, and dodge enemy skills.</li>
    <li><strong>Burst Damage:</strong> Synchro Fission and the enhanced basic attack from Chrono Dash deal significant magic damage, especially when combined with Zaman Force.</li>
    <li><strong>Cooldown Reduction:</strong> Zaman Force greatly reduces the cooldown of Chrono Dash and Synchro Fission, allowing Harith to spam his abilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Key Insight passive provides up to 35% hybrid lifesteal based on the number of nearby enemy heroes, making Harith more durable in fights.</li>
    <li><strong>Area Control:</strong> Zaman Force slows enemies within its area, making it easier to control the battlefield and catch fleeing opponents.</li>
    <li><strong>Shield:</strong> Chrono Dash grants a shield that absorbs damage, providing additional survivability in fights.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Harith Cons:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mana Dependency:</strong> Harith’s skills consume a significant amount of mana, requiring effective mana management or items to sustain his abilities in prolonged fights.</li>
    <li><strong>Skill Reliant:</strong> Harith heavily relies on his skills for damage and mobility. If his skills are on cooldown, he becomes vulnerable.</li>
    <li><strong>Squishy:</strong> Despite his mobility and shield, Harith can be relatively easy to burst down if caught by crowd control or focused by enemies.</li>
    <li><strong>Vulnerable to Crowd Control:</strong> Although Zaman Force provides some resilience, Harith can still be affected by stuns, silences, and other crowd control effects that can interrupt his combos.</li>
    <li><strong>Skill Shot Dependent:</strong> Success with Harith requires accurate skill shots, especially with Synchro Fission and Chrono Dash. Missing these can reduce his effectiveness in fights.</li>
    <li><strong>Late Game Dependence:</strong> Harith needs to scale and acquire items to reach his full potential, making him less effective in the early game compared to other heroes.</li>
</ul>

  <h2>How to Play Harith in Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</h2>
<p>Harith is a dynamic mage known for his ability to manipulate time and zip around the battlefield with ease. Utilizing his mobility effectively will keep your enemies guessing and make it challenging for them to land their skills on you.</p>

<h3>Harith General Gameplay Strategy</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mobility and Dodging:</strong> Harith’s key strength lies in his agility. Use Chrono Dash to move swiftly, dodging enemy skills and positioning yourself for optimal attacks. This constant movement keeps you unpredictable and hard to target.</li>
    <li><strong>Close-Range Combat:</strong> Unlike many mages, Harith excels in close-quarters combat. His skills, especially Synchro Fission, are designed to deal significant damage when used up close. This requires you to get closer to your enemies, making your mobility even more crucial.</li>
    <li><strong>Crowd Control Resilience:</strong> Harith’s passive, Key Insight, reduces the duration of crowd control effects on him. This makes him more resilient against stuns and slows, allowing him to remain active in fights even when targeted.</li>
    <li><strong>Team Fight Role:</strong> In team fights, your goal is to disrupt the enemy and draw their attention away from your more vulnerable allies. Use your skills to deal damage and create chaos, making it hard for the enemy to focus on a single target.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Harith Gameplay Strategy: Mastering Tactics</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Early Game (Level 1-7):</strong> Harith can be relatively weak early on due to limited damage output and mana constraints. Focus on farming minions and avoiding direct confrontations. Use Synchro Fission to clear waves quickly and stay safe.</li>
    <li><strong>Mid Game (Level 8-12):</strong> Once you have a few items, start joining your team for ganks and tower pushes. Chrono Dash combined with Zaman Force can turn the tide in skirmishes, allowing you to control the battlefield and secure kills.</li>
    <li><strong>Late Game (Level 13+):</strong> Stick with your team during the late game. Use Zaman Force to slow down enemies and reduce your cooldowns, enabling you to spam your skills more effectively. Focus on taking down key targets and helping your team push objectives.</li>
</ul>

      <h3>Dominance Ice:</h3>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Dominance Ice:</strong> The passive effect of Dominance Ice counters Harith’s second skill by reducing his attack speed and shielding capabilities, making it a crucial item against him.</p>
  
</div>



<h3>Tips for Playing Against Harith</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Early Game Pressure:</strong> Harith is very strong at levels 1 and 2. Applying early game pressure can hinder his farm and slow down his scaling.</li>
    <li><strong>Crowd Control:</strong> Heroes with short-range lockdown skills are effective in preventing Harith from dashing around. Utilize heroes with strong crowd control abilities to keep him in check.</li>
    <li><strong>Positioning:</strong> Be mindful of your positioning to avoid getting caught in Harith’s ultimate. Spread out to minimize his damage output.</li>
    <li><strong>Bans and Picks:</strong> If you plan to play Harith, consider banning Khufra as his bouncing ball form is a significant counter. Additionally, be cautious of the increased pick rate of Phoveus and Minsitthar when Harith is chosen.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Harith MLBB Guide Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Harith is a high-mobility mage in Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, excelling in burst damage and battlefield agility. His key strength lies in Chrono Dash, allowing him to dodge attacks and reposition quickly, while Synchro Fission and Zaman Force deliver powerful magic damage and reduce cooldowns for continuous assaults. Utilizing his passive, Key Insight, Harith gains resilience against crowd control effects, making him a versatile and durable fighter. Effective play involves mastering combos, maintaining mana management, and strategically engaging in fights to maximize his potential and disrupt enemies.</p>
