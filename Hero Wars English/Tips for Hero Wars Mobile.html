            <h2><b>1. Set a hero to level up</b> </h2><br>
            
            <p>
              Trying to level up 5 heroes or multiple heroes at once can cause problems and make your team weak, instead it's best to choose your favorite assassin hero and progress as much as possible with him.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sometimes, having only one good strong is better than having 5 tolerant heroes. Focus on making the assassin and his tank strong, and then a support. In campaign missions there are MANY quality heroes to invest in; Examples: Astaroth, Artemis, Ginger, Phobos.
            </p>

           

          
            <h2>2. Complete the missions </h2>
            <p>
                Never leave or forget to perform administrative tasks, and that counts for any mobile game. Accomplished missions are your lifeline in mobile games and this is more aggravating if it's Hero Wars. Want to miss out on some rewards that make your hero strong? Of course not? I held off doing all the missions and the result will be great in the long run in Hero Wars!
                        
            </p>
      
            <h2>3. Complete the Hero's Path quests </h2>
            <p>
                Don't forget to do the hero's path tasks, you get a lot of rewards and you also get the hero's path coins that can be used to buy items in the store, I saved buying titan capture spheres, leveling up the titans is very important for your team helps in wars.
            </p>
      

      
    <h2>4. The hardest moment, deciding which heroes to invest</h2>
            <p>Hero Wars offers many heroes to unlock, so it's best to choose 5 heroes that you like. This helps reduce the investment cost of each hero and saves you from spending too much resources or money. You will need in Grand Arena and and in Global War 15 heroes, but don't rush, level up 1 heroes then 2,3,4,5,10,15, 20... Try to focus on assassin, tank, and then supports... Choose a Great Arena team that has Jhu and Mojo, because you will need it for Hydra, later you can change them if you don't like it;

            <h2>5. Unlock instant raid "RAID" </h2>
            <p>
                When you complete a mission with instant raid "RAID" your heroes don't get experience directly, instead the experience points acquired are converted into EXP potions that you can find in your inventory and use to upgrade into any hero in your choice.
                
                It is advised that you purchase Raid Raid to help increase your progress speed in Hero Wars, at least make the cheapest purchase in the emerald shop to unlock the ability to do Instant missions in the game, this will facilitate your progress and allow you to skip a mission and immediately receive the rewards. The value received for instant battles per raid is the same as playing normal. Just make a simple purchase of any item in Hero Wars Mobile and you will already become at least VIP 1 and the Instant Raid Raid will be released. It is very worthwhile and not expensive;
            </p>
       
       
            <h2>6. Complete Campaign Missions </h2>
            <p>
                Completing campaign missions as much as possible (i.e. 3 stars) will grant more benefits, and one of them includes free emeralds which are the most important resource in Hero Wars game. More quests with 3 stars completed = more emeralds. For you to progress in the campaign, you need to focus on the right heroes, Orion, Nebula, Dorian, Martha, they are good heroes for the campaign, but the most important thing is to have very strong heroes, so once again, I advise you, do not try to level up all game heroes at once...
            </p>
  
   
    

       
            <h2>7. Got stuck in the campaign mission, back off and go up a little more power</h2>
            <p>
                Hero Wars is tough when you're doing campaign missions. You start to lose, and this is where you'll need to be smart and rewind your progress and start redoing quests to unlock gear, Gold, and EXP for your heroes and use those resources to power up your heroes.
            </p>
    
        <h2>8. Do the Arena battle every day (RECEIVE EMERALDS) </h2>
        <p>
            Arena at least once a day, you will get free Emeralds from time to time and this is extremely important if you want to really progress in the game. I've seen a lot of players who slack off and don't arena because they don't feel ready yet or just don't like PvP (player versus player) in general, but that's a big mistake and you'll miss out on some nice rewards. Doing the Arena is the best way for you to earn free emeralds. People ask me why I have so many emeralds if I don't spend money on the game, and that's exactly my secret, I try daily to be among the first in the arena in my GMT Arena time, and if possible I try to be in first place;
            
        </p>
        <p>How to get emeralds?</p>
        <p>There are several ways to get emeralds:</p>
   
    <ul class="check-list">  
            <li>Receiving emerald rewards in the Arena </li>
            <li>Completing daily and common quests</li>
            <li>Promoting Star Level Heroes</li>
            <li>Obtaining rewards in the Tournament of Elements</li>
            <li>Completing special events earns free emeralds</li>
            <li>Make in-game purchases</li>
    </ul>
      
       
  
        

    
        <h2>9. Check Alexandre and Kilvinha or Hero Wars channel on Facebook daily </h2>
        <p>
            Hero Wars developers share on Facebook daily reward for players to claim in-game. For those playing on Facebook, check out the Hero Wars Facebook page, and for those on mobile soon we'll be posting daily here or in our Discord group, or on our Facebook page.
            
            Mobile players accurately examine which campaign mission has the secret reward, and after completing the mission, you receive the rewards via the in-game mail system. For Facebook players, login to Facebook, click on post to unlock rewards.
        </p>

    
        <h2>10. Watch ads even if you don't like it </h2>
        <p>
            Some people just hate mobile game ads and ignore them. But if you want to get strong in Hero Wars you will have to watch all the commercials every day to gain extra energy for events, coins, gold, stone from the souls of heroes, etc. every feature is very important in the long run. Watch the commercials for the free boxes twice a day, the shop, the gold exchange, the heroic chest when available, and you will receive resources to use for events and that's good to be prepared;
        </p>

    <h2>11. Learn to use your heroes in battles</h2>
    <p>
        In Hero Wars you will have difficulties in war battles, unless you are a player willing to spend a lot and have invested a good amount of money in the game, and even spending a lot being p2w in the end-game the teams are equal in strength and you will need intelligence and skill to win. So, learn to use your heroes in the best possible way, using the ideal combination to beat teams with more than 100k difference; I record all my battles in a daily logbook, so I know which team my heroes can win and what I need to evolve to beat the opponents, here is the link to my logbook for you to follow and even copy and create your own;
    </p>

    <h2>12. Create or join a guild</h2>
    <p>
        Guilds open up a whole new world of Hero Wars, in which you fight against other guilds and earn guild currency which in turn unlocks insane rewards like unique hero skins, or even some heroes, and most notably the booster book of evolution that will help you a lot to level up the heroes. You still have more to redeem for guild currency, join a guild and you will make many friends and become stronger.
    </p>



    <h2>13. Gather Event Soul Fragments </h2>
    <p>
        Make sure to farm Soul Fragments in events as much as possible. These new shards grant you hero star power and the more star the more power unlike other hero collection games you don't unlock these heroes just by randomly buying them but use event premiums as one of the methods of rewards. You can also use evolution booster to level up your heroes. When your hero already has six stars you can use extra souls in the soul shop and you can buy great items.
    </p>


        <h2>14. Complete the tower daily</h2>
        <p>
            Do the tower daily as it helps to earn equipment shards and more gold. It is very important that you learn to beat the tower early on;
        </p>
