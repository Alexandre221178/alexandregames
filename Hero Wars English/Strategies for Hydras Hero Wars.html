    <h3>Analysis Types of Hydras in Hero Wars</h3>


  
    <h4>Earth Hydra:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Basic Attack:</strong> Deals physical damage.</li>
      <li><strong>Elemental Breath:</strong> Also deals physical damage and has the additional effect of stunning the first hero affected and nearby heroes in a small area.</li>
      <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> The Earth Hydra focuses on physical damage and crowd control, making it important to have heroes with high physical resistance and crowd control immunity in your team to counter its attacks effectively.</li>
    </ul>
 

 
    <h4>Water Hydra:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Basic Attack:</strong> Inflicts physical damage.</li>
      <li><strong>Elemental Breath:</strong> Deals physical damage, with damage scaling based on the proximity of the target. Affected enemies experience a significant slowdown.</li>
      <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> This Hydra poses a threat with its ability to slow down heroes drastically. It's essential to maintain distance and mobility to minimize the impact of its Elemental Breath.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Wind Hydra:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Basic Attack:</strong> Inflicts physical damage.</li>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Basic Attack:</strong> Deals magic damage.</li>

            <h2>The Golden Horn Crate</h2>
            <p>The Golden Horn Crate can be obtained from the Altar of Elements by summoning Titan Elemental Spheres. When you open a Golden Horn Box, you generously gift a Golden Horn of Summoning to each member of your Guild. Additionally, a notification will appear in the Guild chat, announcing the opening of a Golden Horn Box.</p>
            
            <h2>Extra Hydra Battles</h2>
            <p>Each Golden Horn provides an opportunity to launch an attack against the Hydra, even if you have already exhausted your daily allotment of free Summoning Horns. It's advisable to reserve at least 6 extra Golden Summoning Horns for special events, as they do not expire.</p>
            
            <h2>How the Crystal Fairies Work</h2>
            <p>It is now possible to gift your Golden Horns to the fairies, but the Crystal Fairies are only accessible after all the hydra heads have been defeated.</p>
            
            <p>In the end-game, your Guild friends will likely have most of their heroes at maximum level. If the Guild manages the attacks, many will be able to complete the daily mission of fighting the Hydras.</p>
            
            <p>The Crystal Fairies serve as a solution for those Guild mates who cannot receive their summoning sphere prizes if all the hydras are defeated, and they have no opportunity to attack the hydras. This way, they can still receive the summoning spheres from daily missions.</p>
            
            <p>If you have already used your three daily attacks and offer your Golden Horns to the fairies, you will not receive anything in return; you will only spend your Golden Horns. However, if you complete it, the fairies will give you back the daily quest as a reward for the gift.</p>

    <h2>Maximizing Aidan's Potential Against Magical Hydras</h2>

<p>If you've encountered magical Hydras in Hero Wars Alliance, you've likely witnessed the prowess of Aidan. While he's not yet capable of defeating Hydras alone, with the right team, he becomes an indispensable asset. Effectively utilizing Aidan's strengths not only ensures your personal success but also significantly contributes to the growth and prosperity of your guild. In this guide, we'll delve into Aidan's optimal team composition for tackling magical Hydras and enhancing his performance to achieve outstanding damage output.</p>



<h3>Aidan's Best Team 2024 for Magical Hydras:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Martha: Martha's healing abilities and speed provide crucial support, ensuring the team's sustainability during prolonged battles against magical Hydras.</li>
  <li>Aidan: Aidan's devastating attacks are particularly potent against magical Hydras, positioning him as the linchpin of the team's offensive strategy due to his sacrificial abilities that grant buffs to Xe'sha.</li>
  <li>Faceless: Faceless complements Aidan's prowess by replicating his potent abilities, amplifying the team's damage potential with magic penetration artifacts, specifically tailored for combating magical Hydras.</li>
  <li>Xe'sha: Xe'sha's damage increases when allies sacrifice health, aligning perfectly with Aidan's health-sacrificing skills, allowing the team to focus on dealing maximum damage to the Hydra.</li>
  <li>Mush and Shroom: Mush and Shroom's synergy with Martha and Aidan's healing abilities enhances the team's damage output, making them invaluable allies in the battle against magical Hydras.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recommended Team Strategy:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Positioning: Position Aidan in the back line to maximize his damage potential, with Martha providing support from the rear.</li>
  <li>Focus Fire: Coordinate your team's attacks to concentrate damage on the Hydra's weak points, exploiting Xe'sha's ability to deal massive damage with each strike.</li>
  <li>Utilize Crowd Control: Strategically employ Faceless's passive magic defense skill to decrease the Hydra's attacks and minimize damage to your team.</li>
  <li>Maintain Healing: Prioritize Martha's healing to ensure the team's longevity, particularly during prolonged battles against powerful magical Hydras.</li>
  <li>Synergize Abilities: Ensure that Faceless and Mush and Shroom synchronize their abilities with Aidan's attacks, maximizing damage output and efficiency.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Expected Damage Output:</h2>
<p>With the recommended team composition and strategic approach, you can anticipate dealing significant damage to magical Hydras, ranging from 70 million to 220 million points.</p>

    <h2>Best Hydra Team for Beginners in Hero Wars 2024</h2>

    <p>If you're just starting out in Hero Wars and looking to tackle Hydras effectively, Jhu and Mojo are an excellent duo to consider. They are easy to acquire and can form a solid foundation for battling Hydras. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to optimize their performance for Hydra battles:</p>
    
    <h3>1. Acquiring Jhu and Mojo:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Both Jhu and Mojo are relatively easy to obtain heroes, making them accessible choices for beginners.</li>
      <li>Focus on acquiring their Soul Stones through various in-game activities such as Campaign, Store, Boxes and Events.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>2. Understanding Their Synergy:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Jhu and Mojo synergize well together, offering a potent combination of damage and utility.</li>
      <li>Jhu's abilities benefit greatly from Mojo's Hex skill, which continues to deal damage even if Mojo is defeated in battle.</li>
      <li>Mojo's abilities complement Jhu's kit, providing crowd control and additional damage output.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3. Leveling Priorities:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Prioritize leveling up Mojo's Hex ability, as it synergizes exceptionally well with Jhu's attacks.</li>
      <li>Focus on upgrading Jhu's first ability, which renders him invincible, boosts his attack speed, deals pure damage, and restores his health.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>4. Team Composition:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Build a team around Jhu and Mojo, focusing on heroes that enhance their strengths and cover their weaknesses.</li>
      <li>Consider adding support heroes like Martha and Dorian that can further amplify their damage output or provide additional survivability.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>5. Utilizing in Other Modes:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Apart from Hydra battles, Jhu and Mojo can also excel in other game modes such as Tower, Outland, and various missions.</li>
      <li>Leverage their versatility to tackle different challenges and progress further in the game.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>6. Continuous Improvement:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>As you progress in Hero Wars, continue to invest in Jhu and Mojo's development by leveling up their abilities, equipping them with powerful artifacts, and refining their team composition.</li>
      <li>Stay updated on game updates and new heroes that may complement or enhance Jhu and Mojo's effectiveness in Hydra battles.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>By following these steps and harnessing the strengths of Jhu and Mojo, you can build a formidable Hydra team even as a beginner in Hero Wars. Experiment with different strategies, adapt to the evolving game meta, and enjoy the journey of becoming a Hydra-slaying hero!</p>
