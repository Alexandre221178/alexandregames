    <h3>1. Understanding Glyph Class Skills</h3>
    <p>Glyph Class Skills are special abilities that become available to heroes once they reach level 40 in all their current glyphs. These abilities are tied to specific classes such as Tank, Warrior, Marksman, Mage, Healer, Support, and Control. Once unlocked, Class Abilities can be utilized by any hero belonging to that particular class, providing strategic advantages in battles.</p>

    <h3>2. Unlocking Class Abilities</h3>
    <p>To unlock Class Abilities for a specific class, you need to ensure that all heroes belonging to that class have reached level 40 in their respective glyphs. Once this requirement is met, the Class Glyph will unlock, granting access to powerful Class Abilities.</p>
 

    <h3>3. Leveling Up Class Glyphs</h3>
    <p>The power of Class Abilities increases with the level of the Class Glyph. Class Glyph levels are shared among all heroes belonging to the same class. This means that each hero's contribution to leveling up the Class Glyph makes the abilities stronger for all heroes in that class. Aim to have multiple heroes of the same class with maxed-out glyphs to maximize the potency of Class Abilities.</p>

    <h3>4. Acquiring Runic Spheres</h3>
    <p>Runic Spheres are the new resource introduced to increase the maximum cap of current glyphs by 5 levels, up to a maximum level cap of 80. These spheres can be obtained from the upgraded Highwaymen mode in Outland, which now features new Orange-grade opponents and higher rarity chests. Keep participating in the Highwaymen mode to collect Runic Spheres and enhance your glyphs.</p>

    <h3>5. Glyph Upgrade Resources</h3>
    <p>With the introduction of Glyph Class Skills, the enchantment rune system has been revamped. Small, Common, Rare, and Great Enchantment Runes have been converted into Runic Stones, which are now used for glyph upgrades. You can acquire Runic Stones from various sources such as Heroic Chests, Hero’s Way, daily quests, and other in-game activities. Stock up on Runic Stones to upgrade your glyphs and unlock powerful Class Abilities.</p>

    
    <h3>6. Strategic Approach</h3>
    <p>When planning your hero lineup, consider the synergies between Class Abilities and your overall strategy. Each class offers unique advantages, so choose heroes that complement each other to create a well-rounded team. For example, pairing Tank heroes with strong defensive Class Abilities can create an impenetrable frontline, while combining Support and Healer abilities can ensure your team's survivability.</p>

    <h3>7. Prioritize Class Glyphs</h3>
    <p>As you progress in the game, prioritize leveling up Class Glyphs for classes that align with your preferred playstyle or current meta. Investing resources into Class Glyphs that enhance the strengths of your team composition can give you a significant edge in battles. Keep track of which heroes contribute to each Class Glyph and focus on leveling up the glyphs with the most impactful abilities for your strategy.</p>

    <h3>8. Continuous Improvement</h3>
    <p>The introduction of Glyph Class Skills is just the beginning of a new era in Hero Wars Alliance. Stay informed about updates and changes to the glyph system to adapt your strategies accordingly. Keep experimenting with different hero combinations and Class Abilities to discover new synergies and optimize your team's performance.</p>

    <h2>Analysis of Class Glyph Mechanism: Astaroth Example</h2>
    <p>In the realm of Hero Wars Alliance, the introduction of Glyph Class Skills has brought forth a new layer of depth to strategic gameplay. Astaroth, renowned as a stalwart Tank hero, serves as an exemplary illustration of how the Class Glyph system operates.</p>
    
    <p>Astaroth's arsenal consists of five Glyphs: Magic Attack, Armor, Health, Magic Defense, and Strength. Upon reaching the pinnacle of advancement at level 40 in all Glyphs, the coveted Class Glyph is unlocked, granting access to the Tank Class Ability. This Ability, when activated, bestows passive enhancements upon all Tank heroes enlisted in the player's roster, fortifying their resilience and effectiveness on the battlefield.</p>
    
    <p>However, the journey towards mastery does not end with the mere unlocking of the Class Glyph. To unleash the full potential of the Tank Class Ability, players must embark on a quest for ascension through the utilization of Runic Spheres. These mystical spheres serve as catalysts for the augmentation of Astaroth's Glyphs, incrementing the Tank Class Glyph by +1 with each application.</p>
    
    <p>Through the process of Rune Ascend, the Tank Class Ability undergoes a metamorphosis, growing in potency with each subsequent level. Moreover, the level cap of Astaroth's Glyphs is elevated by increments of 5, offering an opportunity for further empowerment. As each ascended Glyph reaches its zenith, players can once again invoke the Ascending ritual, pushing the boundaries of their heroes' capabilities to ever greater heights.</p>
    
    <p>Nevertheless, the ascent towards Glyph supremacy is not without its limits. The Tank Class Glyph's ascent culminates at level 75, marking the zenith of Astaroth's potential. Beyond this threshold, the Glyph reaches a state of equilibrium, its power reaching a harmonious balance with the hero's innate prowess.</p>
    
    <p>In summary, the Class Glyph mechanism, as exemplified by Astaroth's journey, embodies the essence of progression and empowerment in Hero Wars Alliance. Through meticulous strategy and the judicious application of resources, players can unlock the true potential of their heroes, shaping the course of battles and etching their names into the annals of legend.</p>
